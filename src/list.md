## Python lists
Lists are a built-in data structure in python used to store multiple values, accessed with one variable name. 

Typically the values stored in a list are all of the same type, though python does allow for different types to be stored within the same list.

## Creating lists

One way to create a list is to use a *list literal*. For example, instead of creating five variables to store 5 quiz scores, we can store them in a list, like this:

```python
scores = [92, 87, 93, 81, 91]
```

Here is a visual model for how to think of a list and its contents:

Some people prefer to visualize a list and its contents vertically:
