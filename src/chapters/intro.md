# What is this book?
This is the on-line textbook used at the University of Denver for the second-quarter Introduction to Programming 2 course (COMP 1352). This course is a continuation of the preceding quarter (Introduction to Programming 1, COMP 1351). This book is written to teach programming in python, and relies on `dudraw`, a simple in-house graphics package that extends Princeton's `stddraw`. Instructions on software installation can be found in the on-line textbook for COMP 1351, which you can find at [Introduction to Programming 1](https://cs.du.edu/~intropython/intro-to-programming/).
