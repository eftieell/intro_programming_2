# Functions
In this chapter, we will review functions in python. We will include a review of ideas learned in a previous quarter, and some new ideas as well. Several of the sections are duplicates from the textbook from the previous quarter [COMP 1351 Intro to Programming textbook](https://cs.du.edu/~intropython/intro-to-programming)

- The purpose of functions
- How to define and call functions
- Functions that take arguments (input to the function)
- Functions that return values (output from the function)
- Keyword arguments
- Default argument values
- Timing how long it takes for functions to execute
- The "call stack"
