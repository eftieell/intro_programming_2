## Functions that take arguments

You're already familiar with calls to functions that take input values (*arguments*, or *parameters*). For example:

```python
# The `print()` function accepts an argument - the string to output to the console
print("Hello!")

# The dudraw ellipse function takes four arguments
# x-location of center, y-location of center, half-width, and half-height
dudraw.ellipse(0, 0, 1, 0.5)
```
Notice that when you call (i.e., *use*) a function that has parameters, you put those values within the parentheses of the function call. These actual values are called *arguments*. You must pass the correct number of arguments (i.e., the number of values that the defined function is expecting), and they must be passed in the correct order.

We will now learn how to create user-defined functions that accept arguments. When defining the function, we give a name to refer to each value that will be passed by the caller. These named values are called *parameters*, and within the function definition you can treat them just like variables. The parameter name can be used only within the function definition. Here is the template:

```python
def function_name(parameter1_name: parameter1_type, parameter2_name: parameter2_type,...) -> None:
    # Code defining the function
```

Example 1: In the program below, the simple function `greet_user()` outputs `"Hello, world!"` to the console multiple times. The argument to the function determines how many times the greeting is output to the terminal. The argument gives a way of passing information (the number of greetings to output) from the line that calls the function to within the function itself.

<table>
<tr><td>Code</td><td>Output</td></tr>
<tr>
<td nowrap>

```python
def greet_user(num_greetings: int) -> None:
    for i in range(num_greetings):
        print("Hello, world!")

def main():
    greet_user(5)

# Run the program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
</td>

<td>

```
Hello, world!
Hello, world!
Hello, world!
Hello, world!
Hello, world!
```
</tr>
</table>

Example 2: Here we see the definition of a simple function that takes two parameters: the number of greetings to output, and the name of the user.

<table>
<tr><td>Code</td><td>Output</td></tr>
<tr>
<td nowrap>

```python
def greet_user(num_greetings: int, name: str) -> None:
    for i in range(num_greetings):
        print(f"Hello, {name}!")

def main():
    name = input("What is your name? ")
    num = int(input("How many greetings do you want? "))
    greet_user(num, name)

# Run the program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
</td>

<td>

```
What is your name? Mahsa
How many greetings do you want? 3
Hello, Mahsa!
Hello, Mahsa!
Hello, Mahsa!
```
</tr>
</table>

In this course, we will have a standard for commenting functions. After the `def` line, put a block comment (a docstring) explaining the purpose of the function as well as any parameters and what their purpose is. For example:

```python
def greet_user(num_greetings: int, name: str) -> None:
    """ Give greetings to the user, including their name
        parameters:
            num_greetings: number of repetitions of greeting (type: int)
            name: username, to be included in greeting (type: str)
        return: None
    """
    for i in range(num_greetings):
        print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```
