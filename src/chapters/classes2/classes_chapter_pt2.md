## Class, Part 2
In this chapter we look at more details of implementing classes. This includes:
* class customization using "dunder" (double-underscore) methods,
* understanding how variables store references to object,
* drawing memory diagrams representing simple and complex class structures, and
* copying references, shallow copying, and deep copying.
