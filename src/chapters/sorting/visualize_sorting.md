# Visual depictions of sorting algorithms

Many people have created cool visualizations of sorting algorithms. Here are a few good ones:

*  The following link is a good resource if you want to walk step-by-step and see exactly what is happening with each iteration in a given simple sorting algorithm: [https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/ComparisonSort.html](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/ComparisonSort.html)

* Animated explanation of bubble sort: [https://yongdanielliang.github.io/animation/web/BubbleSortNew.html](https://yongdanielliang.github.io/animation/web/BubbleSortNew.html)

* Animated gif of sink sort (just like bubble sort, but starting at the end of the array rather than the beginning, so small items "sink" to the bottom):  [Animated gif of bubble sort](https://www.codeproject.com/KB/recipes/SortVisualization/Bubble_Sort.gif)

* Animated explanation of selection sort: [https://yongdanielliang.github.io/animation/web/SelectionSortNew.html](https://yongdanielliang.github.io/animation/web/SelectionSortNew.html)

* Don't miss this charming video in which near-sighted robots race bubble sort against insert sort (including an explanation of which is better and why): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZRWRjq2CAg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZRWRjq2CAg).

* The following video gives a nice idea of the general process each sorting algorithm follows.

* Ridiculous sorting algorithms: Computer Scientists have invented ridiculously bad sort algorithms just for fun (some of these far worse even than bubble sort). Here are a few:
    * Slow sort: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowsort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowsort)
    * Bogosort (also known as Stupid Sort): [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogosort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogosort)
    * And my favorite, gnome sort. Gnome sort is not worse (or better) than bubble sort, but what is clever about this algorithm is that it does not require a nested loop: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnome_sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnome_sort)
