# Visual depictions of sorting algorithms

Many people have created cool visualizations of sorting algorithms. Here are a few good ones:

*  The following link is a good resource if you want to walk step-by-step and see exactly what is happening with each iteration in a given simple sorting algorithm: <a href = "https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/ComparisonSort.html" target = "blank">https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/ComparisonSort.html</a>

* Animated explanation of bubble sort:

* Animated gif of sink sort (just like bubble sort, but starting at the end of the array rather than the beginning, so small items "sink" to the bottom):  <a href = "https://www.codeproject.com/KB/recipes/SortVisualization/Bubble_Sort.gif" target = "blank">https://www.codeproject.com/KB/recipes/SortVisualization/Bubble_Sort.gif</a>

* Don't miss this charming video in which near-sighted robots race bubble sort against insert sort (including an explanation of which is better and why):

* The following video gives a nice idea of the general process each sorting algorithm follows.

* Ridiculous sorting algorithms: Computer Scientists have invented ridiculously bad sort algorithms just for fun (some of these far worse even than bubble sort). Here are a few:

    * Slow sort: <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowsort" target = "blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowsort</a>
     
    * Bogosort (also known as Stupid Sort): <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogosort" target = "blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogosort</a>
    
    * And my favorite, gnome sort. Gnome sort is not worse (or better) than bubble sort, but what is clever about this algorithm is that it does not require a nested loop: <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnome_sort" target = "blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnome_sort</a>
