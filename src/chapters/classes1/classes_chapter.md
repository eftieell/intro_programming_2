# Classes

One of the key concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) is its use of classes. Implementing and using classes allows us to modularize our code, providing organization to large programs. Classes allow us to more easily write code that is reusable, debuggable, and extendible. Using classes, we can divide programs into separate parts that different people can work on simultaneously.
