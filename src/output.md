## Outputting information from the program to the user

In python, use the `print()` function to output information to the user.

Here is a run-of-the-mill print statement:
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
When you run this line of code, the following is output this to the console:
```python
Hello, World!
```

The following two lines demonstrate that when you have two print statements, they get executed in order. 
```python
print("Hello")
print("World")
```
The output shows that each print statement automatically takes you to the next line on the console.
```python
Hello
World
```

You can put two or more strings in a print statement, separated by a comma:
```python
print("Hello", "World", "!")
```
The output shows that a space automatically is inserted between each parameter:
```python
Hello World !
```
