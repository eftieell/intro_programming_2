<p>This is the on-line textbook used at the University of Denver for the second-quarter Introduction to Programming 2 course (COMP 1352). This course is a continuation of the preceding quarter (Introduction to Programming 1, COMP 1351). This book is written to teach programming in python, and relies on <code>dudraw</code>, a simple in-house graphics package that extends Princeton's <code>stddraw</code>. Instructions on software installation can be found in the on-line textbook for COMP 1351, which you can find at <a href="https://cs.du.edu/~intropython/intro-to-programming/">Introduction to Programming 1</a>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="review-of-producing-animations-using-the-dudraw-graphics-package"><a class="header" href="#review-of-producing-animations-using-the-dudraw-graphics-package">Review of producing animations using the dudraw graphics package</a></h1>
<p>The present section reviews how to animate drawings using the <code>dudraw</code> package, assuming you already know how to create simple drawings using <code>dudraw</code>.
Basic information about creating static drawings using <code>dudraw</code> can be found in a section of the COMP 1351 text here: <a href="https://cs.du.edu/~intropython/intro-to-programming/dudraw_quickstart.html">dudraw basics</a>.</p>
<p>Here is the typical outline of a <code>dudraw</code> animation program:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import dudraw

def main():
    # set up the dudraw canvas

    # initialize the attributes of object you are animating (position, size, etc.)

    # main animation loop (infinite loop, later we will give a way for users to quit)
    while True:
        # clear background

        # redraw the next frame

        # display the frame and pause

        # Prepare for next frame by advancing the attributes of the animated object(s)
        #  (move position, change size, etc.)

        # Check for user input (key presses or mouse presses)


if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    main()

</code></pre>
<p>Check for key presses by using <code>dudraw.next_key()</code>, which returns a single character if a key was pressed, and returns an empty string (<code>''</code>) if no key has been pressed since the most recent query.</p>
<p>Check for mouse clicks using <code>dudraw.mouse_clicked()</code>. Sometimes you may need to recognize if the mouse is currently pressed and not yet released (so you can process dragging of the mouse). Then use <code>dudraw.mouse_is_pressed()</code>. Occasionally you may also need the supporting functions <code>dudraw.mouse_dragged()</code> and <code>dudraw.mouse_released()</code>.</p>
<p>Here's a simplest example of an animation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import dudraw

# Animates a circle moving to the upper right.
# Quits when user types 'q'. When mouse is clicked,
# the circle's position sets to the clicked position.
def main():
    # set up the dudraw canvas
    dudraw.set_canvas_size(400, 400)
    # no call to dudraw.set_x_scale() or dudraw.set_y_scale()
    # means we are accepting the default of x in [0, 1] and y in [0, 1]
    # Since the canvas is 400x400 pixels, this means one pixel is 0.0025 units wide

    # initialize the position of the circle
    x = 0.1
    y = 0.5

    key = ''
    # main animation loop (infinite loop, later we will give a way for users to quit)
    while key.lower() != 'q':
        # clear background
        dudraw.clear(dudraw.LIGHT_GRAY)

        # redraw the next frame. The circle has a radius of 10 pixels.
        dudraw.filled_circle(x, y, 0.025)

        # display the frame and pause (20 milliseconds = 50 frames per second)
        dudraw.show(20)

        # Prepare for the  next frame by moving circle, one pixel
        x += .0025
        y += .0025
        # Save keypress to check for 'q' next time through the loop
        key = dudraw.next_key()
        # if the mouse has been clicked, reset the x, y position to
        # the clicked location
        if dudraw.mouse_clicked():
            x = dudraw.mouse_x()
            y = dudraw.mouse_y()        


if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    main()

<p>Here's a video demonstrating the above code running:</p>
<p><video src="https://cs.du.edu/~ftl/1352/videos/simplest_animation.mov" width="320" height="320" controls></video></p>
<p>To animate more complex objects, create a function that displays the object at the position given by parameters. (or, once you have learned to use classes, perhaps you will implement a method of a class to draw the object). Here's an example. Notice that very little of the <code>main()</code> function changed compared to the previous program, other than ignoring mouse clicks.</p>

Python lists are mutable (the contents can be modified after creation), and can store any data type. If the individual elements of a list are each themselves a list, the result is a <em>nested list</em> (or <em>2D list</em>).</p>
<h2 id="creating-new-lists"><a class="header" href="#creating-new-lists">Creating new lists</a></h2>
<p>There are several ways to create new lists in python:</p>
<ul>
<li>List literals: write the comma-separated contents within square brackets, storing the list in a variable:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python"># contents of lists can be any type
greek_letters = ['alpha', 'beta', 'gamma', 'delta']
some_primes = [385351, 217739, 854123, 769733, 898091]
# lists can be nested
scores = [[94, 78, 56], [67, 82, 91]]
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Create an empty list, then append elements within a loop:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python">ten_odds = []
for i in range(10):
    ten_odds.append(2*i+1)

# get input from user, appending each entry into list:
friends = []
num_friends = int(input(&quot;How many friends? &quot;))
for i in range(num_friends):
    friend_name = input(&quot;Enter a name: &quot;)
    friends.append(friend_name)
print(friends)
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Use python's built-in <code>list()</code> function (called a 'constructor').
Pass any existing iterable (list, range object, tuple, string, dictionary) as the parameter,
and a new list will be created using its data.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python">greek_letters = ['alpha', 'beta', 'gamma', 'delta']
# create a new list, a copy of an existing list
copy_of_greek_letters = list(greek_letters)
# changing the copied list does not affect the original
copy_of_greek_letters.append('epsilon')
print(copy_of_greek_letters)  # alpha through epsilon
print(greek_letters) # still just alpha through delta

# create a list of the individual characters in a string
letters = list('haleakala') # letters is now ['h', 'a', 'l', 'e', 'a', 'k', 'a', 'l', 'a']
# create a list from the elements in a range object
values = list(range(1, 10)) # values is now [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# create a dictionary literal:
numbers = {1: 'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three'}
# create a list of the keys from an existing dictionary:
nums = list(numbers.keys())         # nums is [1, 2, 3]
# create a list of the values from an existing dictionary:
num_names = list(numbers.values())  # num_names is ['one', 'two', 'three']
# create a list of the (key, value) tuple pairs from an existing dictionary:
num_items = list(numbers.items())   #num_items is [(1, 'one'), (2, 'two'), (3, 'three')]
</code></pre>
<h2 id="accessing-elements-in-a-list"><a class="header" href="#accessing-elements-in-a-list">Accessing elements in a list</a></h2>
<p>You can access (view or change) each element in a list using its index value 
(the number of its location in the list) within square brackets. For example, <code>list_name[n]</code>.</p>
<p>Elements in a list are indexed starting at 0, so <code>list_name[0]</code> gives the value of the first element of the list,
and <code>list_name[n]</code> gives the value of the n+1st element in the list.</p>
<p>You can find out the number of elements in a python list with <code>len(list_name)</code>. 
So the value of the last element of a list is <code>list_name[len(list_name)-1]</code>. 
Alternately, in python, you can use an index of -1 for the last element of a list, so <code>list_name[-1]</code> is the value of the last element.
(Note that using an index value of -1 is not part of Java or C++, and will result in an index out of bounds error)</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">languages = [&quot;C++&quot;, &quot;python&quot;, &quot;Java&quot;, &quot;Perl&quot;, &quot;JavaScript&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;Go&quot;, &quot;Rust&quot;, &quot;Haskell&quot;, &quot;Perl&quot;]

# Access the first element in a list with an index value of 0
# Outputs &quot;I can program in C++&quot;&quot;
print(f&quot;I can program in {languages[0]}&quot;)

# Access the last element in a list with an index value of len(languages)-1 or -1:
# Both of the next lines output &quot;I can program in Perl&quot;
print(f&quot;I can program in {languages[len(languages)-1]}&quot;)
print(f&quot;I can program in {languages[-1]}&quot;)

# Lists are mutable, so you can modify the value of an element in the list using its index:
# This changes the first language in the list from &quot;C++&quot; to &quot;C#&quot;
languages[0] = &quot;C#&quot;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="removing-elements-from-a-list"><a class="header" href="#removing-elements-from-a-list">Removing elements from a list</a></h2>
<p>There are multiple ways to remove an element from a list in python. Here are two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the <code>remove()</code> list method. The parameter you pass is the <em>value</em> you want to remove. 
So the <code>remove()</code> method traverses through the list until it reaches the <em>first</em> instance of the value. That value is then removed from the list.
Details: this method does not return a value. If the value you want to return is not found in the list, python throws a <code>ValueError</code>.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Remove the first instance of &quot;Perl&quot; from the list
languages.remove(&quot;Perl&quot;)
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Use the <code>pop()</code> list method. The parameter you pass is the <em>index</em> you want to remove.
Details: the <code>pop()</code> method returns the value of the element it removed. If the index you pass as a parameter is invalid, python throws an <code>IndexError</code>.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Remove the index 1 element (2nd element) from the list
removed = languages.pop(1)
print(removed)   # the output is &quot;python&quot;, and &quot;python&quot; is no longer in the list
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Similar to <code>pop()</code>, you can use the <code>del</code> keyword to remove an element at a specific index. Details: the value stored at that index is not returned. If the index is invalid, python throws an <code>IndexError</code>.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Remove the index 0 element (first element) from the list
del languages[0]
</code></pre>
<h2 id="traversing-lists"><a class="header" href="#traversing-lists">Traversing lists</a></h2>
<p>You can traverse lists three different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>you can use an index (index-based traversal), or </li>
<li>you can traverse directly through the values of the list (content-based traversal), or</li>
<li>you can traverse using <code>enumerate()</code>, which tracks both index and content.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="example-showing-three-techniques-for-traversing-a-list"><a class="header" href="#example-showing-three-techniques-for-traversing-a-list">Example showing three techniques for traversing a list:</a></h3>
<pre><code class="language-python"># index-based traversal through list:
# Here, i iterates over all indexes in the list (0 through len(languages)-1)
for i in range(len(languages)):
    print(f&quot;I can program in {languages[i]}&quot;)

# content-based traversal through list:
# Here, language iterates over all values stored in the list
for language in languages:
    print(f&quot;I can program in {language}&quot;)

# traversal through list using enumerate()
# (allows you to track index and value simultaneously)
# Here, one variable (i) holds the index and another (language) holds the value

    # Separate the phrases with commas
    if i != len(languages) - 1:

    # when you get to the last language, end sentence with an exclamation point
    else:
        print(f&quot;I love {language}!&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Note that above in the use of <code>enumerate()</code>, we access the value with the variable <code>language</code>.
But instead, since the index is available, we could have used <code>languages[i]</code>.</p>
<h2 id="the-in-keyword"><a class="header" href="#the-in-keyword">The <code>in</code> keyword</a></h2>
<p>You can use the <code>in</code> keyword to determine if a value exists anywhere in the list. It returns a True/False result.</p>

<p>There is a long list of methods you can use to help you manipulate lists. Please see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists">Official python documentation on lists</a> for detailed information.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="review-of-python-dictionaries"><a class="header" href="#review-of-python-dictionaries">Review of python dictionaries</a></h1>
<p>A python dictionary is a built-in data structure that holds (key, value) pairs. The key/value pairs are called <em>items</em>.
The purpose of a dictionary is to store these pairs in a way that makes it very efficient to look up the value given the key.
Python dictionaries are mutable (the contents may be modified after creation). 
The keys themselves must be of an immutable type, but the values may be any data type 
(including dictionaries and lists, making for a nested data structure).</p>
<h2 id="creating-new-dictionaries"><a class="header" href="#creating-new-dictionaries">Creating new dictionaries</a></h2>
<p>There are several ways to create new dictionaries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dictionary literals: Each key and value is separated with a colon, while the key:value pairs are separated by commas.
Then the comma-separated pairs are placed within a pair of curly braces:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python"># dictionary literal for looking up state capitals:

<li>Create an empty dictionary, then append elements within a loop (this strategy is especially useful
for building a dictionary from data stored in a file):</li>

<p>Given a key, you can look up the associated value in a dictionary using square brackets. 
The keys act much like the index in a list, but they do not have to be integers!
Put the key within square brackets (<code>dictionary_name[key]</code>). This expression gives the value associated with that key.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Using the state_capitals dictionary defined above, this line outputs &quot;Juneau&quot;

</code></pre>
<p>Sample output:</p>
<pre><code>How old are you? 3
You are three years old!
</code></pre>
<p>Alternately, you can look up the value associated with a key using the <code>get()</code> method. Pass the key as a parameter.</p>

<p>If you try to access a non-existent key in a dictionary with <code>dictionary_name[key]</code>, python crashes with a <code>KeyError</code>. 
You can address this issue in multiple ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the python dictionary <code>get()</code> method. If the key is not found, it will not crash - instead it returns <code>None</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Sample output:</p>
<pre><code>What state's capital do you want to know? Minneshota
The capital of Minneshota is None.
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Use the <code>in</code> keyword to confirm the key is in the dictionary before accessing it:</li>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="list-comprehension"><a class="header" href="#list-comprehension">List Comprehension</a></h1>
<p>List comprehension is a convenient strategy built into python for creating lists by manipulating existing 
lists, range objects, or other iterable objects. (Note that list comprehension is not part of Java or C++,
but you will see it again in other functional programming languages.)</p>
<p>The idea of list comprehension is to include the definition of a loop within the one line that creates the list.</p>
<h3 id="example-1"><a class="header" href="#example-1">Example 1</a></h3>
<p>Here is some code that creates a list of the first ten positive odd integers:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">ten_odds = []
for i in range(10):
    ten_odds.append(2*i+1)
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the expression <code>2*i+1</code> gives the values to append to the list,
while the code <code>for i in range(10)</code> gives the values to use for the variable <code>i</code>. In list comprehension, 
both of these are embedded into the one-line definition of the list. The line below creates
the identical list:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">ten_odds = [2*i+1 for i in range(10)]
</code></pre>
<h2 id="generate-new-lists-using-any-iterable-object"><a class="header" href="#generate-new-lists-using-any-iterable-object">Generate new lists using any iterable object</a></h2>
<p>The examples below demonstrate that you can use list comprehension to create new lists, by traversing any iterable object.</p>
<h3 id="example-2"><a class="header" href="#example-2">Example 2</a></h3>
<p>Consider this list:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">digits = ['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9']
</code></pre>
<p>That sam list can be defined more robustly using list comprehension:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">digits = [str(i) for i in range(10)]
</code></pre>
<p>With practice, you'll use list-comprehension creatively in a wide variety of applications.</p>
<h3 id="example-3"><a class="header" href="#example-3">Example 3</a></h3>
<p>You can create lists using list comprehension by looping over <em>any</em> iterable object. Here we iterate over an existing list:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23]
primes_squared = [prime*prime for prime in primes]
</code></pre>
<p>For reference, here is the code that accomplishes the same task using a for-loop:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23]
primes_squared = []
for prime in primes:
    primes_squared.append(prime*prime)
</code></pre>
<h3 id="example-4"><a class="header" href="#example-4">Example 4</a></h3>
<p>You can break a string into a list of its individual characters:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">letters = [character for character in 'Hello, World']
# letters = ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', ',', ' ', 'W', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd']
</code></pre>
<h3 id="example-5"><a class="header" href="#example-5">Example 5</a></h3>
<p>You can create a list from an existing dictionary's keys, or values:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">us_state_to_abbrev = {
    &quot;Alabama&quot;: &quot;AL&quot;,
    &quot;Alaska&quot;: &quot;AK&quot;,
    &quot;Arizona&quot;: &quot;AZ&quot;,
    # etc...
}
# state_names is a list of all of the state names (a list of the keys extracted from us_state_to_abbrev dictionary)
state_names = [state_name for state_name in us_state_to_abbrev.keys()]
# abbreviations is a list of all of the state abbreviations (a list of the values extracted from us_state_to_abbrev dictionary)
abbreviations = [abbrev for abbrev in us_state_to_abbrev.values()]
</code></pre>
<h2 id="list-comprehension-and-conditionals"><a class="header" href="#list-comprehension-and-conditionals">List Comprehension and conditionals</a></h2>
<p>We've seen list comprehension of the form</p>
<p><strong>new_list = [<em>value</em> for <em>variable</em> in <em>iterable</em>]</strong></p>
<p>Now we'll add a conditional (an if-clause) to restrict some of the values from being included in the list:</p>
<p><strong>new_list = [<em>value</em> for <em>variable</em> in <em>iterable</em> if <em>conditional_expression</em>]</strong></p>
<h3 id="example-6"><a class="header" href="#example-6">Example 6</a></h3>
<p>Yet another strategy for producing a list of the first ten odd numbers:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">ten_odds = [i for i in range(20) if i%2==1]
</code></pre>
<h3 id="example-7"><a class="header" href="#example-7">Example 7</a></h3>
<p>Extract all of the upper-case letters from an existing string:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">letters = [character for character in 'Hello, World' if character.isupper()]
# letters = ['H', 'W']
</code></pre>
<h3 id="example-8"><a class="header" href="#example-8">Example 8</a></h3>
<p>A more involved example, extracting from the state-to-abbreviations dictionary all state abbreviations that start with a vowel.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">us_state_to_abbrev = {
    &quot;Alabama&quot;: &quot;AL&quot;,
    &quot;Alaska&quot;: &quot;AK&quot;,
    &quot;Arizona&quot;: &quot;AZ&quot;,
    # etc...
}
vowel_abbrev = [abbrev for abbrev in us_state_to_abbrev.values() if abbrev[0].lower() in &quot;aeiou&quot;]
# vowel_abbrev = ['AL', 'AK', 'AZ', 'AR', 'ID', 'IL', 'IN', 'IA', 'OH', 'OK', 'OR', 'UT']
</code></pre>
<h2 id="nested-loops-in-list-comprehension"><a class="header" href="#nested-loops-in-list-comprehension">Nested loops in list comprehension</a></h2>
<p>The iteration within a list comprehension can be a nested loop:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">digits = ['1', '2', '3']
letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']
new_list1 = [digit + letter for digit in digits for letter in letters]
# new_list1 = ['1a', '1b', '1c', '2a', '2b', '2c', '3a', '3b', '3c']
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the nested loop above does <em>not</em> create a nested list - it is still a 1D list, constructed with a nested loop.</p>
<p>As always with nested loops, it matters which loop is on the outside. 
In the above example, the first for statement (<code>for digit in digits</code>) is the outside loop,
while the second for statement (<code>for letter in letters</code>) is the inside loop.
This means that we start with the first element in the outside loop (<code>digit = '1'</code>), and entirely complete
the inside loop (<code>for letter in letters</code>) before proceeding to the next element in the outside loop (<code>digit = '2'</code>).
After completing the inside loop (<code>for letter in letters</code>) entirely with <code>digit = '2'</code>, we then move to the next element
of the outer loop (<code>digit = '3'</code>).
This explains the order that the elements are appended to the list (all of the 1s, then all of the 2s then all of the 3s): <code>new_list1 = ['1a', '1b', '1c', '2a', '2b', '2c', '3a', '3b', '3c']</code>.</p>
<p>Notice what happens when we switch the order of the two for-loops. </p>
<pre><code class="language-python">digits = ['1', '2', '3']
letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']
new_list2 = [digit + letter for letter in letters for digit in digits]
# new_list2 = ['1a', '2a', '3a', '1b', '2b', '3b', '1c', '2c', '3c']
</code></pre>
<p>The outer for-loop is now <code>for letter in letters</code> and the
inner for-loop is now <code>for digit in digits</code>. This means that elements using <code>letter = 'a'</code> are all appended before moving on to
all elements using <code>letter = 'b'</code>, and finally all elements using <code>letter = c</code>. 
The list therefore starts with all the 'a's, then all the 'b's, then all the 'c's: <code>new_list2 = ['1a', '2a', '3a', '1b', '2b', '3b', '1c', '2c', '3c']</code></p>
<h2 id="creating-nested-lists-with-a-2d-list-comprehension"><a class="header" href="#creating-nested-lists-with-a-2d-list-comprehension">Creating nested lists with a 2D list comprehension</a></h2>
<p>You can also use list comprehension to create nested lists. At first the syntax seems similar to list comprehension with nested loops,
but notice the all-important extra set of list brackets (<code>[]</code>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">digits = ['1', '2', '3']
letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']
nested_list = [[digit + letter for letter in letters] for digit in digits]
# nested_list = [['1a', '1b', '1c'], ['2a', '2b', '2c'], ['3a', '3b', '3c']]
</code></pre>
<p>Here we have a list comprehension with the loop <code>for digit in digits</code>. For each of those digits, an entire list is created,
resulting in a list of lists. Each internal list is itself created with a list comprehension (<code>[digit + letter for letter in letters]</code>)
So we have a nested list-comprehension (not a list comprehension with nested loops). The makes the result a nested list. 
(<code>nested_list = [['1a', '1b', '1c'], ['2a', '2b', '2c'], ['3a', '3b', '3c']]</code>).</p>

<p>Think of a list as a linear storage of multiple values.</p>

<p>In python you can also have two-dimensional (2D) lists. A 2D list is a matrix or grid of values.</p>

<h2 id="why-do-we-need-2d-lists"><a class="header" href="#why-do-we-need-2d-lists">Why do we need 2D lists?</a></h2>
<p>There are many uses for 2D lists in programming. For example, many games require storage of information in two dimensions.
Writing a computer program in python to implement any of the following games would likely use a 2D list:</p>
<figure>
<img src="chapters/lists_and_dicts/games_2D.png" alt="Images of 2-dimensional games" class="center", width="500">
</figure>
<p>Another example is the storage of digital images, which can be stored as 2D lists. If you zoom in closely on a digital image, you will see that the image is composed of small squares of color called pixels (the word comes from “<em>pic</em>ture <em>el</em>ements”).
So the image can be stored as a 2D grid of colors. In python this is a 2D list, or a list of lists.</p>
<figure>
<img src="chapters/lists_and_dicts/pixels.png" alt="Visual demonstrating how images are composed of pixels" class="center", width="500">
</figure>
<p>Third, sometimes information is best organized in a grid. In these cases, the data would be stored in a 2D list. For example, here's a table that stores the temperature recorded by several different sensors at several times of day:</p>
<figure>
<img src="chapters/lists_and_dicts/temperatures.png" alt="Table of temperatures for several sensors at several times" class="center", width="500">
</figure>
<p>And here's a table showing the average heating bill for several different apartments during each quarter of the year:</p>
<figure>
<img src="chapters/lists_and_dicts/heating_bill.png" alt="Table of heating bills" class="center", width="500">
</figure>
<p>Next we will look at how 2D lists are stored in python as lists of lists.</p>
<h2 id="defining-2d-lists-in-python"><a class="header" href="#defining-2d-lists-in-python">Defining 2D lists in python</a></h2>
<p>One way to create a 2D list in python is to use a 2D <em>list literal</em>. You've already learned how to create a 1D list literal, and the syntax here is similar. However, instead of a simple list, here we have a list of lists, or nested list.</p>
<p>The python code below creates a list of lists that stores the contents of the heating bill table shown above:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">heating_bill = [
    [112, 32, 10, 96],
    [60, 15, 0, 70],
    [196, 65, 15, 180]
]
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that <code>heating_bill</code> is a list with 3 items. Each item is itself a list. </p>
<ul>
<li>The first element <code>heating_bill[0]</code> is itself a list: <code>[112, 32, 10, 96]</code>.</li>
<li>The second element<code> heating_bill[1]</code> is itself a list: <code>[60, 15, 0, 70]</code>.</li>
<li>The third element heating_bill[2] is itself a list: <code>[196, 65, 15, 180]</code>.</li>
</ul>

<figure>
<img src="chapters/lists_and_dicts/2D_indices.png" alt="Accessing 2D lists using indices" class="center", width="500">
</figure>
<p>Rather than focusing on a 2D list as a list of lists, another perspective is to think of it as a rectangular grid, each position having a row position and a column position. So to indicate a specific element, you give two index values. The first index gives the row and the second index gives the column.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>heating_bill[0][0]</code> refers to row index <code>0</code>, column index <code>0</code>, whose value is <code>112</code>.</li>
<li><code>heating_bill[2][3]</code> refers to row index <code>2</code>, column index <code>3</code>, whose value is <code>180</code>.</li>
<li><code>heating_bill[1][2]</code> refers to row index <code>1</code>, column index <code>2</code>, whose value is <code>0</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The keys for the <code>populations</code> dictionary are &quot;CO&quot;, &quot;IL&quot;, &quot;CA&quot;, and &quot;MA&quot;. The expression <code>populations[&quot;CA&quot;]</code> evaluates to an
entire dictionary, which can itself be indexed with its keys &quot;Los Angeles&quot;, &quot;San Diego&quot;, and &quot;Fresno&quot;. Thus the expression

<p>Note that it would not have worked to create one dictionary with just the city names and corresponding populations. Keys must be unique - but there are two cities with the same name! So adding the second &quot;Springfield&quot; to the dictionary would have overwritten the first &quot;Springfield&quot;. Cities within states though, are required to have distinct names (you can't have two towns named Springfield within the same state), so we didn't run into this issue with our original structure. This is why the question asked you to produce a new key, that included the name of the city together with the state abbreviation.</p>
<p>One subtle point in the above code is the creation of that new key. The expression <code>city + &quot;, &quot; + state</code> is a string concatenation, building the name in the form &quot;city, state&quot;.</p>

<li>using a content-based loop</li>
<li>using an index-based loop</li>

</ul>

<p>Notice that each iteration through the outer loop processes one row of the main list (in other words, <code>row</code> is one of the inner lists).
So here the variable <code>row</code> is itself a list! That's why in the inner loop we can execute another for loop, traversing through
the list <code>row</code>. In the inner loop, for each iteration through the loop, city is an entry in the list for that state. 
Giving clear names to the variables is part of documenting your code well.</p>
<h3 id="index-based-traversal-of-a-2d-list"><a class="header" href="#index-based-traversal-of-a-2d-list">Index-based traversal of a 2D list:</a></h3>

<p>This time the outer loop traverses over each index of rows, meaning <code>row_index</code> varies through 0, 1, 2, 3. When <code>row_index == 0</code>, we will look at the cities in Colorado, when <code>row_index == 1</code>, we will look at the cities in California, when <code>row_index==2</code>, we will look at the cities in Illinois, and when <code>row_index == 3</code>, we will look at the cities in Massachusetts. For each value of <code>row_index</code>, our inner loop has <code>col_index</code> taking the values 0, 1 and 2 (one value of <code>col_index</code> for each city in that state).
Then inside the two loops, <code>more_cities[row_index][col_index]</code> accesses the city name for the relevant row index and column index.</p>
<p>Important note on number of rows and number of columns: <code>len(more_cities)</code> gives the number rows. Since <code>more_cities</code> is a list of lists, its length is the number of lists (which is the number of rows, or 4). Notice that <code>more_cities[row_index]</code> is itself a list (because it is one of the rows). So <code>len(more_cities[row_index])</code> gives the number of columns in that row, or 3.</p>
<p>By knowing the index values (rather than just the content stored at each location), we can determine when we are on the last one
(either the last row or the last column). This gives us a way to put all of the cities for each state on one line.</p>

<p>Some programmers prefer this method most, since it allows us to know the index value ('row_index' and 'col_index'), but also to have easier access to the value stored there (just <code>city</code> instead of <code>more_cities[row_index][col_index]</code>).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="computation-traversing-nested-lists"><a class="header" href="#computation-traversing-nested-lists">Computation traversing nested lists</a></h1>
<p>If we have a 2D list of numbers, we might be interested in doing computations on the numbers in the list.</p>
<ul>
<li>We can compute the sum, maximum, or average of all elements in the 2D list.</li>
<li>We can compute the sum, maximum, or average of a specific row.</li>
<li>We can compute the sum,  max/min, or average of a specific column.</li>
<li>We can compute the sum, max/min, or average of each row.</li>
<li>We can compute the sum,  max/min, or average of each column</li>
</ul>
<p>The code needed to compute each of these differs in subtle, but very important ways.
We'll demonstrate this with an example.</p>
<p>Suppose we have a table of quiz scores for students in a course.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Student</th><th>Quiz 1</th><th>Quiz 2</th><th>Quiz 3</th><th>Quiz 4</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Student 1</td><td>78</td><td>83</td><td>62</td><td>91</td></tr>
<tr><td>Student 2</td><td>93</td><td>69</td><td>88</td><td>72</td></tr>
<tr><td>Student 3</td><td>75</td><td>82</td><td>78</td><td>83</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>The scores are stored in this 2D list:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">scores = [
    [78, 83, 62, 91],
    [93, 69, 88, 72],
    [75, 82, 78, 83],
]
</code></pre>
<h3 id="compute-a-quantity-for-the-entire-2d-list"><a class="header" href="#compute-a-quantity-for-the-entire-2d-list">Compute a quantity for the entire 2D list</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes we want to compute a quantity using all 12 elements in the 3x4 matrix. This requires us to traverse through every element
in the 2D list. We've seen previously multiple ways to do this (index-based traversal, content-based traversal, or using <code>enumerate()</code>).
We review the process with the code below, which finds the maximum value of all 12 scores in the 2D list, using index-based loops.
Notice that in this code block, the outer loop iterates over each row index, while the inner loop iterates over each column index.
This means that we visit each list element in row-major order. In other words, we first traverse every element in the first row, then every element
in the second row, then every element in the third row.
Detail: <code>len(scores)</code> gives the number of rows, while <code>len(scores(row_index))</code> gives the number of columns in a specific row.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Maximum value of all scores in the 2D list.
# In the outer loop, have the row index vary through index values 0, 1, 2, 
# and in the inner loop, have the column index vary through index values 0, 1, 2, 3.
# Before beginning, initialize the maximum to be the first score in the first list.
maximum = scores[0][0]
for row_index in range(0, len(scores)):
    for column_index in range(0, len(scores[row_index])):
        if scores[row_index][column_index] &gt; maximum:
            maximum = scores[row_index][column_index]
print(maximum) # outputs 93
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the given 2D list is rectangular, not jagged. In other words, each row has the same number of columns.
In this situation, we can actually reverse the order of the loops. In other words, the outer loop can vary over each of the column
indexes 0, 1, 2, 3, while the inner loop varies over each row index 0, 1, 2. Reversing the order of the loops results in us visiting the
list elements in column-major order. So we first traverse every element in the first column, then every element in the second column,
then every element in the third column, and finally every element in the fourth column. Since we are finding a result that treats every
element in the matrix equally, it's fine to switch the order. Detail: <code>len(scores)</code> gives the number of rows. But one quirk of the
column-major ordering is that the number of elements in each column must be the same. 
For the number of columns, we will just use the number of columns in the first row, <code>len(scores[0])</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Maximum value of all scores in the 2D list, computed in column-major order.
# In the outer loop, have the column index vary through index values 0, 1, 2, 3
# and in the inner loop, have the row index vary through index values 0, 1, 2.
# Before beginning, initialize the maximum to be the first score in the first list.
maximum = scores[0][0]
for column_index in range(0, len(scores[0])):
    for row_index in range(0, len(scores)):
        if scores[row_index][column_index] &gt; maximum:
            maximum = scores[row_index][column_index]
print(maximum) # outputs 93
</code></pre>
<h3 id="compute-a-quantity-for-a-single-row"><a class="header" href="#compute-a-quantity-for-a-single-row">Compute a quantity for a single row</a></h3>
<p>If we want to calculate a quantity just for a single row, we do not need a nested loop.
Since the row index never changes, we allow the column index to traverse all possible columns with a single for loop.
This means that the <code>column_index</code> will vary from 0 to <code>len(scores[row_index])-1</code> 
(the number of columns is <code>len(scores[row_index])</code>).
The code below calculates the average of Student 3's scores.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Average score for student 3. The row_index of 2 doesn't change.
# The column_index varies from 0 to 3. Add up all four scores, then
# divide by the number of columns (the number of scores).
total = 0
for column_index in range(0, len(scores[2])):
    total += scores[2][column_index]
average = total/len(scores[2])
print(average) # outputs 79.5
</code></pre>
<h3 id="compute-a-quantity-for-a-single-column"><a class="header" href="#compute-a-quantity-for-a-single-column">Compute a quantity for a single column</a></h3>
<p>If we now want calculate a quantity for only one specific column, there is similarly no need for a nested loop.
Instead, the column index never changes, but the row index traverses over all possible rows.
This means that the <code>row_index</code> will vary from 0 to <code>len[scores]-1</code> (the number of rows is <code>len[scores])</code>.
The code below calculates the average of all students on Quiz 4.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Average score of all students on Quiz 4. The column_index of 3 doesn't change.
# The row_index varies from 0 to 2. Add up all 3 scores, then divide
# by the number of rows (the number of students)
total = 0
for row_index in range(0, len(scores)):
    total += scores[row_index][3]
average = total/len(scores)
print(average) # outputs 82.0
</code></pre>
<h3 id="compute-a-quantity-for-every-row-individually"><a class="header" href="#compute-a-quantity-for-every-row-individually">Compute a quantity for every row individually</a></h3>
<p>Say we want to calculate a quantity for every row separately. Since we're finding the quantity for each row, and
the quantity requires us to look at every column, we'll need to examine every value in the matrix.
This means we must use nested for-loops. 
Since we are calculating a quantity row-wise, the outside loop <em>must</em> vary throughout the rows.
Allow the row_index to vary throughout each row, then in the inner loop compute the quantity for that single row (see two sections above).
The code below finds the average score for each student separately.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Average score for every student. The row_index changes in the outer
# loop. For each row_index, the column_index varies from 0 to 3, through
# each quiz score for that student. Add up all four scores, then
# divide by the number of columns.
for row_index in range(0, len(scores)):
    total = 0
    for column_index in range(0, len(scores[row_index])):
        total += scores[row_index][column_index]
    average = total/len(scores[row_index])
    print(average) # This line is executed 3 times, outputting 78.5, then 80.5, then 79.5
</code></pre>
<p>Since the quantity is being calculated separately for each row, 
notice that the initialization of variables must happen <em>inside</em> the outer loop, but <em>outside</em> the inner loop.
So the initialization <code>total=0</code> is indented, executing as the first line inside the outer loop. That total is reset to 0 for each
student. Notice also that we want to print the result separately for each student. Thus the print statement is indented one level.
The output is executed once for each student, at the end of the computation for that student.</p>
<h3 id="compute-a-quantity-for-every-column-individually"><a class="header" href="#compute-a-quantity-for-every-column-individually">Compute a quantity for every column individually</a></h3>
<p>Say we want to calculate a quantity for every column separately. This computation requires us to visit every value in the matrix,
so we must use a nested for-loop. But since we are doing a column-wise computation, the outer loop must vary over each column.
A matrix must be rectangular (not jagged) for this to work. In the outside loop, allow the col_index to vary over every column. 
Then within that loop, compute the quantity you want by looking at the values for each row within that column. This means the inner
loop will vary over every possible row.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Minimum score for each quiz. The column_index changes in the outer
# loop. For each column_index, the row_index varies from 0 to 2, through
# each quiz score for that student. Each time we find a score smaller
# than we've seen yet for that quiz, update the minimum
for column_index in range(0, len(scores[0])):
    # initialize minimum to the first row in this column
    minimum = scores[0][column_index]
    for row_index in range(0, len(scores)):
        if scores[row_index][column_index] &lt; minimum:   
            minimum = scores[row_index][column_index]  
    print(minimum) # This line executes 4 times, outputting 75, then 69, then 62, then 72
</code></pre>
<p>Because we are doing a separate computation for each column, notice that the initialization of <code>minimum</code> happens just inside the outer
for-loop. We initialize <code>minimum</code> to the first student's score on that quiz. Then at the end of the inner loop, the output of the result
is indented one level, so it is output once for each column.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we will review functions in python. We will include a review of ideas learned in a previous quarter, and some new ideas as well. Several of the sections are duplicates from the textbook from the previous quarter <a href="https://cs.du.edu/~intropython/intro-to-programming">COMP 1351 Intro to Programming textbook</a></p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="user-defined-functions-in-python"><a class="header" href="#user-defined-functions-in-python">User-defined functions in python</a></h1>
<p>Most programming languages give you a way to separate a block of code from the main program. This is useful to</p>
<ul>
<li>provide organization to your program by chunking it into blocks that perform specific tasks, and</li>
<li>allow you to reuse a block of code rather than repeat it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="creating-user-defined-functions"><a class="header" href="#creating-user-defined-functions">Creating user-defined functions</a></h2>
<p>This is the syntax for creating a user-defined function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def function_name() -&gt; None:
    # Code block for the function
</code></pre>
<p>Key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The keyword <code>def</code> signals the beginning of a function definition.</li>
<li>The empty pair of parentheses <code>()</code> indicates that this function does not take any arguments (input values to the function). Function arguments are explained in a later section.</li>
<li>The <code>-&gt; None</code> indicates that the function does not return any values. Function return values are explained in a later section.</li>
<li>Defining functions is not completely new to you - you have defined the function <code>main()</code> in every program you have written.</li>
<li>When you define a function, note that the code in the function is <strong>not executed</strong>. The code within the function is executed only when you <em>call</em> the function.</li>
<li>Think of the function definition as a recipe, telling python exactly what to do when another part of the program calls the function.</li>
<li><em>Calling</em> a function means to use it, or to <em>run its code</em>. We also say <em>execute</em> the function or <em>invoke the function</em>.  To call a function, at the point where you want it to run, write the name of the function, with parentheses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Here is the definition of a function called <code>greet_user()</code>. It asks the user their name, then says hello, using their name:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def greet_user() -&gt; None:
    name = input(&quot;What is your name? &quot;)
    print(&quot;Hello,&quot;, name)
</code></pre>
<p>In the above code, nothing is executed. The lines of code within the function only get executed when the function is called. Consider the following program that defines and uses (calls) the function <code>greet_user()</code>:</p>
<figure>
<img src="chapters/functions/greet_user.png" alt="definition and use of greet_user() function" class="center", width="300">
</figure>
<p>In the above code, lines 1-3 are the <em>definition</em> of the <code>greet_user()</code> function. Those lines define what you want python to do whenever <code>greet_user()</code> is called. On line 6, the <code>greet_user()</code> function is called. So when python executes line 6, it puts <code>main()</code> on hold, jumps to line 1, and executes the contents of the <code>greet_user()</code> function. That's the moment that the user is asked for their name, and the greeting is output. After that completes, the running of the program reverts back to line 6 in <code>main()</code> and continues from there.</p>
<h2 id="commenting-functions"><a class="header" href="#commenting-functions">Commenting functions</a></h2>
<p>In this course, we will have a standard for commenting every function. After the <code>def</code> line, put a block comment explaining the purpose of the function. This special block comment is called a <em>docstring</em>. When we learn about parameters and return values, we will add additional information into these docstrings.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def greet_user() -&gt; None:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    First example of a user-defined function. Ask user for their name, then
    output &quot;Hello, &quot;, followed by their name
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    name = input(&quot;What is your name? &quot;)
    print(&quot;Hello,&quot;, name)
</code></pre>
<h2 id="putting-it-all-together"><a class="header" href="#putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together</a></h2>
<p>The following code shows a program that defines and uses several functions. Each of these functions defines how to draw a part of the final image. The definition of each function has been collapsed - you can't see the contents. This is actually helpful, because while looking at the program from the highest level, the details are distracting. Notice that in <code>main()</code> we can easily see the overall task of the program from the four function calls. If the details of drawing each shape were placed into one long <code>main()</code> function, the higher-level organization of the program would be lost, mired in the details. This demonstrates the importance of using functions to break down code into bite-sized chunks.</p>

<h2 id="summary"><a class="header" href="#summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p>A function definition is a collection of code statements grouped together that perform a specific task.</p>
<p>Every function has a name that can be used to <em>call</em> the function. We also use the terms <em>invoke</em>, or <em>execute</em> to mean <em>run the lines of code that appear within the function definition</em>.</p>
<p>You can think of the function definition as a recipe for how to perform a task. When the function is invoked, then the task is actually performed.</p>
<h3 id="why-use-functions"><a class="header" href="#why-use-functions">Why use functions?</a></h3>
<p>There are three main reasons that functions are useful in programming:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reusability</p>
<p>Often we need to use the same code multiple times.
One solution is to copy/paste the code to reuse it. A downside of that strategy is that it makes our programs much longer. But an even worse downside is that if we make a modification, we need to find and make that same change in every place we copied the code to. Functions instead allow us to efficiently invoke the same code whenever needed without making multiple copies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abstraction</p>
<p>Once a function has been written and tested, we don't need to know how it works anymore. We only need to remember its <strong>name, purpose, parameters, and return value</strong>. For example, when you use the <code>dudraw.circle()</code> function, you can just use it without bothering your mind with the distraction of how that function creates the circle. This allows us to build functions from functions already written, and thus produce very complicated software much more easily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Code organization and readability</p>
<p>Organizing  your code into a sequence of function calls allows you to focus while you are programming on just the task at hand. It also makes it far easier for others to read your code and understand it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="next-up-arguments-and-return-values"><a class="header" href="#next-up-arguments-and-return-values">Next up: arguments and return values</a></h3>
<p>The next two sections cover the following topics:</p>
<p>Functions may take input values (called arguments or parameters) that modify or control how the function runs. This allows the line of code that invokes the function to pass needed information to the function.</p>
<p>Functions may also have output values (called return values). Usually this is the result of some work that the function has completed. It is a way for the function to pass back needed information to the function that called it. </p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="functions-that-take-arguments"><a class="header" href="#functions-that-take-arguments">Functions that take arguments</a></h2>
<p>You're already familiar with calls to functions that take input values (<em>arguments</em>, or <em>parameters</em>). For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># The `print()` function accepts an argument - the string to output to the console
print(&quot;Hello!&quot;)

# The dudraw ellipse function takes four arguments
# x-location of center, y-location of center, half-width, and half-height
dudraw.ellipse(0, 0, 1, 0.5)
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that when you call (i.e., <em>use</em>) a function that has parameters, you put those values within the parentheses of the function call. These actual values are called <em>arguments</em>. You must pass the correct number of arguments (i.e., the number of values that the defined function is expecting), and they must be passed in the correct order.</p>
<p>We will now learn how to create user-defined functions that accept arguments. When defining the function, we give a name to refer to each value that will be passed by the caller. These named values are called <em>parameters</em>, and within the function definition you can treat them just like variables. The parameter name can be used only within the function definition. Here is the template:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def function_name(parameter1_name: parameter1_type, parameter2_name: parameter2_type,...) -&gt; None:
    # Code defining the function
</code></pre>
<p>Example 1: In the program below, the simple function <code>greet_user()</code> outputs <code>&quot;Hello, world!&quot;</code> to the console multiple times. The argument to the function determines how many times the greeting is output to the terminal. The argument gives a way of passing information (the number of greetings to output) from the line that calls the function to within the function itself.</p>
<table>
<tr><td>Code</td><td>Output</td></tr>
<tr>
<td nowrap>
<pre><code class="language-python">def greet_user(num_greetings: int) -&gt; None:
    for i in range(num_greetings):
        print(f&quot;Hello, world!&quot;)

def main():
    greet_user(5)

# Run the program:

    main()
</code></pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre><code>Hello, world!
Hello, world!
Hello, world!
Hello, world!
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Example 2: Here we see the definition of a simple function that takes two parameters: the number of greetings to output, and the name of the user.</p>
<table>
<tr><td>Code</td><td>Output</td></tr>
<tr>
<td nowrap>
<pre><code class="language-python">def greet_user(num_greetings: int, name: str) -&gt; None:

def main():
    name = input(&quot;What is your name? &quot;)
    num = int(input(&quot;How many greetings do you want? &quot;))
    greet_user(num, name)

</td>
<td>
<pre><code>What is your name? Mahsa
How many greetings do you want? 3
Hello, Mahsa!
Hello, Mahsa!
Hello, Mahsa!
</code></pre>
</tr>
</table>
<p>In this course, we will have a standard for commenting functions. After the <code>def</code> line, put a block comment (a docstring) explaining the purpose of the function as well as any parameters and what their purpose is. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def greet_user(num_greetings: int, name: str) -&gt; None:
    &quot;&quot;&quot; Give greetings to the user, including their name
        parameters:
            num_greetings: number of repetitions of greeting (type: int)
            name: username, to be included in greeting (type: str)
        return: None
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    for i in range(num_greetings):
        print(f&quot;Hello, {name}!&quot;)
</code></pre>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="a-function-can-return-a-value"><a class="header" href="#a-function-can-return-a-value">A function can return a value</a></h1>
<p>Once a function completes its task, sometimes it is useful for the function to <em>return</em> a result to the line of code that called it. You can choose the type of the returned value. If no value is returned, then the return type is <code>None</code>.</p>
<p>For example, the print function, as in</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(&quot;Hello!&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>takes an argument (the input to the function is <code>&quot;Hello&quot;</code>), but it does not return a value.</p>
<p>But the <code>input()</code> function does return a value: it returns what the user typed. The return type is <code>str</code>.  When the function is <em>invoked</em>, it returns a value after it is done executing. You may do whatever is useful with that return value. In the example below the value returned by the <code>input()</code> function is stored in the variable <code>name</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">name = input(&quot;Enter your name: &quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>In the above line, the right-hand-side of the assignment statement is an expression whose value is whatever the <code>input()</code> function returned. So the return value of <code>input()</code> is stored in the variable <code>name</code>.</p>
<p>Another example is the <code>random()</code> function, which returns a <code>float</code>. We may choose to store the value that is returned in a variable. Or we may choose to pass that return value as an argument to another function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Store the return value in a variable:
x_position = random()
# Pass the return value to the print function:
print(random())
</code></pre>
<h2 id="user-defined-functions-that-return-values"><a class="header" href="#user-defined-functions-that-return-values">User-defined functions that return values</a></h2>
<p>When you define a function, you only need to do so once. Once defined, however, a function may be invoked (used) many times. You can think of a function as an opaque box that performs work with optional inputs and an optional output.</p>
<p>The syntax is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def function_name(optional parameters) -&gt; return type:
    # Indented code block
    # Optional return statement
    # (You may leave out the return statement if the function returns `None`)
</code></pre>
<p>Example:
Here's a function that takes a <code>float</code> parameter named <code>temp_f</code> that represents a temperature in Fahrenheit (think of <code>temp_f</code> as an input value to the function). The function then computes the conversion of the temperature to Celsius. The converted value <code>temp_c</code> of type <code>float</code> is returned (think of <code>temp_c</code> as an output value from the function).</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def celsius(temp_f: float) -&gt; float:
    # compute the conversion from fahrenheit to celsius
    temp_c = (temp_f - 32) * 5 / 9
    return temp_c
</code></pre>
<p>In the example above, think of the parameter <code>temp_f</code> as a local variable of the <code>celsius()</code> function. That variable can only be accessed <em>within</em> the scope of the function. When the function completes execution, the variable <code>temp_f</code> is destroyed and can no longer be accessed. On the last line of the function, the <code>return</code> statement has the effect of sending the value <code>temp_c</code> back to the line that invoked the function. Here is a sample of how the <code>celsius()</code> function might be invoked:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">    user_temp_f = float(input(&quot;Please enter the temperature in Fahrenheit: &quot;))
    user_temp_c = celsius(user_temp_f)
    print(f&quot;{user_temp_f} degrees Fahrenheit is {user_temp_c:.1f} degrees Celsius&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>The first line gets a <code>float</code> Fahrenheit temperature from the user.
The second line calls (invokes) the <code>celsius()</code> function. The value of the variable <code>user_temp_f</code> is passed as the parameter to the <code>celsius()</code> function. Within the <code>celsius()</code> function, that value is stored in the <code>temp_f</code> variable and the result is computed. Then the <code>celsius()</code> function returns the <code>float</code> value result. Back in the main code block, the right-hand-side of the assignment statement evaluates to the return value from <code>celsius()</code>. So that value is stored in the <code>user_temp_c</code> variable.
The last line gives full formatted output to the user.</p>
<p>Note that <code>celsius(user_temp_f)</code> is actually an expression, with a value (the return value) and a type (<code>float</code>). This means we can put <code>celsius(user_temp_f)</code> in our code <em>anywhere</em> that we can validly put any expression. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">    print(celsius(user_temp_f))
</code></pre>
<p>In the above line of code, <code>celsius(user_temp_f)</code> is an expression whose value is whatever the <code>celsius</code> function returns. That value is passed in turn as a parameter to the <code>print()</code> function! This might remind you of function composition in algebra, where the output from one function is fed in as the input to another function. A more sophisticated example of this is shown below, a compression of the previous example from  three lines of code into two:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">user_temp_f = float(input(&quot;Please enter the temperature in Fahrenheit: &quot;))
print(f&quot;{user_temp_f} degrees Fahrenheit is {celsius(user_temp_f):.1f} degrees Celsius&quot;)
</code></pre>
<h2 id="boolean-functions"><a class="header" href="#boolean-functions">Boolean functions</a></h2>
<p>Note that a function may return a value of type <code>bool</code>. These are called <em>boolean functions</em>, and just as before, the return value can be used as an expression. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def first_digit_even(number: int) -&gt; bool:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Determine whether or not the first digit (leftmost digit) of a decimal number is even.
    parameters:
        number: a positive integer (type: int)
    return:
        True if number if first digit is even, False if first digit is odd
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    # Keep dividing by 10 until the number is less than 10
    while number &gt;= 10:
        number = number // 10

    # Now we have a one-digit number. See if that digit is even
    return number%2 == 0
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>while</code>-loop repeatedly divides by 10 using integer division (shifting the number to the right), until only one digit remains. That digit is the first digit (left-most digit) of the original number. Then on the last line, the expression <code>number%2==0</code> evaluates to <code>True</code>  if that first digit is even, and <code>False</code> if that first digit is odd. The <code>True</code> or <code>False</code> value gets returned.</p>
<p>Here's an example of a code snippet that uses the function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">user_num = int(input(&quot;Enter a positive integer: &quot;))
if first_digit_even(user_num):
    print(f&quot;The first digit of {user_num} is even.&quot;)
else:
    print(f&quot;The first digit of {user_num} is odd.&quot;)
</code></pre>
<h2 id="putting-it-all-together-1"><a class="header" href="#putting-it-all-together-1">Putting it all together</a></h2>
<p>The following example code defines and uses a boolean function <code>is_prime()</code> that determines whether or not an integer is prime.
A prime number is an integer bigger than 1 that is divisible only by 1 and by itself.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def is_prime(number: int) -&gt; bool:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    A function that determines whether or not a number is prime
    parameters:
        number: a positive integer greater than 1 (type: int)
    return:
        True if number is prime, False otherwise (type: bool)
    &quot;&quot;&quot;

    # tester is a possible factor. Start at 2 and we will increase it
    tester = 2

    while tester &lt; number:
        if number % tester == 0:
            # We now know that tester divides number, so
            # we know the answer - number is not prime!
            # The function teriminates, returning False
            return False
        else:
            tester += 1

    # We only reach this line if no return False above ever occurred.
    # This means that the number has no factors and thus it is prime
    return True
    
def main():
    # The user inputs an integer and we determine if it is prime
    num = int(input(&quot;Enter an integer to test for primality: &quot;))
    if is_prime(num):
        print(f&quot;{num} is prime&quot;)
    else:
        print(f&quot;{num} is not prime&quot;)

# Run the program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</code></pre>
<p>Key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The input for this function is an integer bigger than 1 (our program would be improved if we checked for this condition).</li>
<li>The output is a boolean (<code>True</code> if <code>number</code> is prime, <code>False</code> otherwise).</li>
<li>It's helpful for boolean functions to have names that reflect that they return a <code>True/False</code> result. Here, <code>is_prime()</code> reads like a question that has a yes/no answer. When we call the function, the line
<code>if is_prime(23):</code> makes sense when we read it.</li>
<li>A function should only perform one task. Here, the job is to determine whether or not the number is prime. The function does <em>not</em> output the result to the console. The function just returns the <code>True</code>/<code>False</code> result to the line that invoked it. It's up to the caller to interact with the user. This philosophy makes for more flexible and reusable functions.</li>
<li>Within the loop of the <code>is_prime()</code> function, we can only return <code>False</code>, never <code>True</code>. Because only by completing the entire loop can we know that <code>number</code> has no factors (other than 1 and itself). The <code>return True</code> can thus only happen after the loop has completed.</li>
<li>The program could be made to run more efficiently by stopping the loop after <code>tester</code> reaches the square root of <code>number</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>By placing the code to determine whether a number is prime into a separate function, we can now re-use it in  multiple ways. For example, here is a new <code>main()</code> function that outputs all primes less than <code>1000</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def main():
    # Output all primes less than 1000, testing each number one by one
    for i in range(2, 1000):
        if is_prime(i):
            # output the number if it is prime:
            print(i, end = &quot; &quot;)
    # Move output to a new line
    print()
</code></pre>
<p>You should notice how simple it was to create this new program. The <code>is_prime()</code> function did not need to be rewritten or even thought about. This is the power of creating functions that perform well-defined tasks.</p>
<p>Here is yet another example. This time we will build another layer on top of the <code>is_prime()</code> function by creating a function called <code>next_prime()</code> to give the next prime larger than a specific integer. Notice that <code>next_prime()</code> itself uses <code>is_prime()</code>, so its job is made straightforward and easy to understand. By the use of these two functions, the interface with the user in <code>main()</code> is also very straightforward. This organization and structure makes code easier to read and understand, easier to fix if it has an error, and easier to enhance or modify if we choose to later. Notice that the contents of <code>is_prime()</code> are not shown here, since that function is identical to before.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def is_prime(number: int) -&gt; bool:
    # contents not shown - it's unchanged from before!

def next_prime(number: int) -&gt; int:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Return the first prime greater than or equal to number
    parameters:
        number: input value for which we need to return the next prime (type: int)
    return:
        a prime value greater than or equal to number (type: int)
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    # start from number, and increment until we find the next prime
    while not is_prime(number):
        number += 1
    # The loop has terminated, so the current value of number must be the next prime.
    return number
    

def main():
    n = int(input(&quot;Give me a number and I will tell you the next prime: &quot;))
    print(f&quot;The next prime is {next_prime(n)}&quot;)

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="default-argument-values"><a class="header" href="#default-argument-values">Default argument values</a></h1>
<p>Default argument values give a way to make it optional for the caller to pass an argument to a function.
In fact, you've already seen examples of optional arguments to functions.
Perhaps you have noticed that some functions can be called with different numbers of arguments. 
For example, you can call <code>dudraw.clear()</code> with either no arguments or one argument:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">dudraw.clear(dudraw.GREEN)  # clears the canvas, all pixels are now GREEN
dudraw.clear()              # this time no argument is passed - so the default is to clear with dudraw.WHITE
</code></pre>
<p>Here's another example. You may pass an argument to <code>print()</code> to specify what the end character is. But you may also leave that argument out, in which case <code>print()</code> ends with a newline.</p>
<p>Without the end character optional argument:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># The code below puts &quot;Hello&quot; and &quot;World&quot; on two different lines, 
# since the default end character for print() is a newline (&quot;\n&quot;):
print(&quot;Hello,&quot;)
print(&quot;World&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>Hello,
World!
</code></pre>
<p>With the end character optional argument:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Alternately, we can pass an optional extra argument to print().
# The first print() statement below ends with a space rather than the default newline.
# So the two strings are output separated by a space, not a newline.
print(&quot;Hello,&quot;, end = &quot; &quot;)
print(&quot;World!&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>Hello, World!
</code></pre>
<h2 id="how-does-this-work"><a class="header" href="#how-does-this-work">How does this work?</a></h2>
<p>Behind the scenes, in the definition of <code>dudraw.clear()</code> a default value for the argument is specified (namely <code>dudraw.WHITE</code>). By doing so, it allows the client code (your code) to either include or omit that argument. If you include the argument, it specifies the background color. But if you omit that argument, then the function uses the default value <code>dudraw.WHITE</code> as the color. The default value is specified in the definition of the function.</p>
<p>Similarly, you may include or omit an additional argument to <code>print()</code> to specify the end character. (for example, <code>end = &quot; &quot;</code>). If you call <code>print()</code> without the <code>end</code> parameter, then <code>print()</code> automatically uses the default end value <code>&quot;\n&quot;</code>.</p>
<h2 id="defining-your-own-functions-with-default-argument-values"><a class="header" href="#defining-your-own-functions-with-default-argument-values">Defining your own functions with default argument values</a></h2>
<p>If you want to create functions that can be called with or without one or more of the arguments, specify <code>parameter_name = default_value</code> in the function header. If you specify a default value, then it becomes optional to pass that argument when the function is called.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># The greet() function outputs &quot;Hello, {name}!&quot;. The default value for name is &quot;World&quot;.
# So if no name is passed as a parameter, then the function outputs &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
def greet(name: str = &quot;World&quot;):
    print(&quot;Hello, &quot; + name + &quot;!&quot;)

def main():
    greet(&quot;Sami&quot;)    # outputs &quot;Hello, Sami!&quot;
    greet(&quot;Phyllis&quot;) # outputs &quot;Hello, Phyllis!&quot;
    greet()          # outputs &quot;Hello, World!&quot;

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    main()
</code></pre>
<p>If there are two or more parameters, then mandatory arguments must come first. So always put
parameters with default values at the end of the parameter list. Here's another example (taken from python documentation <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#default-argument-values">https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#default-argument-values</a>).</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># There are three parameters. The second two parameters have default values.
def ask_ok(prompt, retries=4, reminder='Please try again!'):
    while True:
        reply = input(prompt)
        if reply in {'y', 'ye', 'yes'}:
            return True
        if reply in {'n', 'no', 'nop', 'nope'}:
            return False
        retries = retries - 1
        if retries &lt; 0:
            raise ValueError('invalid user response')
        print(reminder)
</code></pre>
<p>The above function can be called multiple ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>giving only the mandatory argument: <code>ask_ok('Do you really want to quit?')</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>giving one of the optional arguments: <code>ask_ok('OK to overwrite the file?', 2)</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or even giving all arguments: <code>ask_ok('OK to overwrite the file?', 2, 'Come on, only yes or no!')</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="keyword-arguments"><a class="header" href="#keyword-arguments">Keyword arguments</a></h1>
<p>In the header of a function definition, you name the parameters. These names are local variable names, meaning that the variables are only accessible within the function definition itself. In the line that <em>invokes</em> (or <em>calls</em>) the function, values (called <em>arguments</em>) are passed to fill in as the values of the parameters. These arguments must be passed in the correct order. Consider this example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def attribute(author: str, title: str)-&gt;None:
    print(f&quot;{author} wrote the book {title}.&quot;)

def main():
    attribute(&quot;Richard Wright&quot;, &quot;Native Son&quot;)
    # Oops, here's a bug, the arguments are in the wrong order!
    attribute(&quot;Harry Potter&quot;, &quot;J.K. Rowling&quot;)

# Run the program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>Richard Wright wrote the book Native Son.
Harry Potter wrote the book J.K. Rowling.
</code></pre>
<p>In <code>main()</code>, the line </p>
<pre><code>attribute(&quot;Richard Wright&quot;, &quot;Native Son&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>invokes the <code>attribute()</code> function, with <code>&quot;Richard Wright&quot;</code> as the <code>author</code> and <code>&quot;Native Son&quot;</code> as the title. Notice, however, that the arguments are mistakenly in the wrong order on the next line:</p>
<pre><code>attribute(&quot;Harry Potter&quot;, &quot;J.K. Rowling&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p><code>&quot;Harry Potter&quot;</code> should have been the second argument (the title), and <code>&quot;J.K. Rowling&quot;</code> should have been the first argument (the author). Keyword arguments are intended to avoid bugs created by this type of mistake, and to simultaneously make code more readable.</p>
<p>To use a keyword argument, we give the name of the parameter along with the argument. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">attribute(author = &quot;Richard Wright&quot;, title = &quot;Native Son&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>The parameter names should exactly match the names given in the definition of the function itself. VSCode will tell you the name of the parameters so you don't have to refer back to the function definition to remember the names and order of the parameters. To access this feature, type Command-Shift-Space on a Mac, or Control-Shift-Space on Windows. This image shows what the parameter-hinting looks like in VSCode:</p>
<img src="chapters/functions/parameter_hinting.png"  width="50%" height="50%" alt = "When you invoke a function, VSCode tells you the parameter names">
<p>When you use keyword arguments, your code is often easier to understand, because the names of the variables makes the meaning of each argument clear.
If you use keyword arguments and you put the arguments in the wrong order, the values of the arguments are assigned by the variable names, not the order. However, we strongly advise that even when using keywords, you maintain the order of the variables in the function definition. Using the features of your IDE makes this easy.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Use keyword arguments to clarify and to reduce bugs:
attribute(author = &quot;Margaret Wise Brown&quot;, title = &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot;)
# Above we use keyword arguments with the arguments out of order
# Below is poor programming practice since the parameters are out of order. But notice that it still works:
attribute(title = &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, author = &quot;J.K. Rowling&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>Margaret Wise Brown wrote the book Goodnight Moon.
J.K. Rowling wrote the book Harry Potter.

<p>As we write more complicated code, it becomes increasingly important to make it execute quickly.

<p>The overall strategy is simple: </p>

<p>If a function takes a parameter that represents the size of the problem (number of elements in a list, or number of repeats of a loop),
then we are very interested in how the execution time grows as the size of the problem grows. 
The pattern of this change is called the <em>order of growth</em> or <em>time complexity</em> of the algorithm.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If doubling the size of <code>n</code> results in a doubling of the execution time for the algorithm, then we call the algorithm <em>Big-O of n</em> or <em>linear</em>. We write this \(O(n)\).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If doubling the size of <code>n</code> results in a quadrupling of the execution time, then we call the algorithm &quot;Big-O of n squared&quot; or &quot;quadratic&quot;. We write this \(O(n^2)\).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If doubling the size of <code>n</code> results in a factor of 8 increase of the execution time, then we call the algorithm &quot;Big-O of n-cubed&quot; or &quot;cubic&quot;. We write this \(O(n^3)\).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The code below is a modification of the original timing code, but with an extra loop that modifies the size of <code>n</code>.
Carefully compare the two versions, enough so you could make the modification yourself.</p>

<p>We can see by a rough look at the data above that the algorithm shows linear, or \(O(n)\), behavior. Look at the time behavior when <code>n</code> is doubled or tripled:</p>
<p>When the size of <code>n</code> is doubled from 100 million to 200 million, the time approximately doubles (\(.18 sec/3.13 sec \approx 1.97\)).</p>
<p>When the size of <code>n</code> is tripled from 100 million to 300 million, the time approximately triples (\(9.24/3.13 \approx 2.95\)).</p>
<p>When the size of <code>n</code> is doubled from 300 million to 600 million, the time approximately doubles (\(18.69/9.24 \approx 2.02\)).</p>
<p>When the size of <code>n</code> is tripled from 200 million to 600 million, the time approximately triples (\(18.69/6.18 \approx 3.02\)).</p>

<p>This time, a rough look at the data above indicates that the algorithm shows quadratic, or \(O(n^2)\), behavior. Look at the time behavior when <code>n</code> is doubled or tripled:</p>
<p>When the size of <code>n</code> is doubled from 10000 to 20000, the time increases by approximately a factor of 4 \(12.37/3.09 \approx 4.003\)).</p>
<p>When the size of <code>n</code> is tripled from 10000 to 30000, the time increases by approximately a factor of 9 (\(28.08/3.09 \approx 9.09\)).</p>
<p>When the size of <code>n</code> is doubled from 30000 to 60000, the time increases by approximately a factor of 4 (\(116.78/28.08 \approx 4.16\)).</p>
<p>When the size of <code>n</code> is tripled from 20000 to 60000, the time increases by approximately a factor of 9 (\(116.78/12.37 \approx 9.44\))</p>
<p>Graphing the data hints at a parabolic (quadratic) shape. Caution though: while this graph convinces us that
the time complexity is not linear, graphs that are concave up might represent quadratic, cubic, exponential, or other growth rates.</p>

<p>If a function takes less than 1 second to execute, then the technique above is often not accurate.
Instead, we must execute the function multiple times (so the total elapsed time is more than 1 second), 
then divide by the number of times the function was called, to get the average execution time. You will learn this technique in a future course.</p>

<p>Consider a python program that has function calls. Here is a simplest example:</p>
<pre><code>def my_function(val: int):
    print(f&quot;In my_function line 2, val is {val}&quot;)
    val = val + 10
    print(f&quot;In my_function line 4, val is {val}&quot;)
    return val

def main():
    value = 23
    print(&quot;In main, line 9&quot;)
    another = my_function(value)
    print(f&quot;In main, line 11, value: {value}, another_value: {another}&quot;)


if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    main()
</code></pre>
<p>Below is an image of the same program, with line numbers that we will refer to while tracing the function.
<img src="chapters/functions/simple_call_stack.png" alt="code with functions main and my_function" width="500"/></p>
<p>Please stop reading for a moment to trace the code by hand, giving the output. Run the code to double-check.</p>
<p>Notice that when the code runs line 10, it must evaluate the right-hand side by calling <code>my_function(value)</code> before it can
store the return value in the variable <code>another</code>. When the function <code>my_function(value)</code> is called, running of the function <code>main()</code> is paused until <code>my_function</code> completes running and returns. At that point program control returns to line 10 and
picks back up where it left off.
When we trace code by hand, we naturally remember exactly where we paused, and even the values of the local variables. This allows us seamlessly resume running line 10 after <code>my_function</code> completes executing and returns. However, unlike humans, computers have no natural or automatic process for remembering. Thus, when a function is called, all information about the current values of local variables and the line currently being executed must be stored. This information is all stored in the <em>call stack</em>.</p>
<p>The call stack consists of individual frames. When a function begins execution, a frame is added to the top of the call stack (we say it is &quot;pushed&quot; onto the stack). Each frame stores the current line number being executed, as well as the values of every local variable. When a new
function is invoked, a new frame is created and added to the top of the call stack.</p>
<p>Here is a memory diagram showing the state of the call stack when the program is executing line 7:</p>
<img src="chapters/functions/call_stack_line_7.png" alt="call stack memory diagram line 7" width="200"/>
<p>The next line creates a variable called <code>value</code>, and stores <code>23</code> there. On line 9, output is sent to the terminal. Here is the call stack memory diagram when the program is executing line 9. Notice that a new local variable to represent <code>value</code> has been added to the frame for the function <code>main</code>:</p>
<img src="chapters/functions/call_stack_line_9.png" alt="call stack memory diagram line 9" width="200"/>
<p>On line 10, the program calls the function <code>my_function()</code>. This means that the funtion <code>main()</code> pauses its execution. A new frame for this call to <code>my_function</code> is created and added to the top of the call stack. The top frame on the call stack always shows the information for the function that is currently executing. Here is the call stack memory diagram when the program has invoked <code>my_function()</code> and is executing line 2. Notice that <code>val</code> is passed as a parameter, so it behaves like a local variable. Its value is initialized with the value that was passed (23 in this case). The variable <code>val</code> exists only as long as <code>my_function()</code> is still executing. Thus we draw it in the frame associated with <code>my_function()</code>:</p>
<img src="chapters/functions/call_stack_line_2.png" alt="call stack memory diagram line 2" width="200"/>
<p>On line 3, the value stored in <code>val</code> is changed. Notice that only the local variable is modified. Since <code>my_function()</code> only has access to the local variables stored in its own frame, the variables owned by <code>main()</code> cannot be modified by this function. Here is the call stack memory diagram when the program is executing line 4:</p>
<img src="chapters/functions/call_stack_line_4.png" alt="call stack memory diagram line 4" width="200"/>
<p>On line 5 of the program, <code>my_function()</code> has completed execution and will return program control to the calling function (<code>main()</code> in this case). Python knows which frame to return to and which line to resume by looking at the <em>next frame down on the stack</em>. So the return value is passed back to the function call in the frame below, the frame for <code>my_function()</code> is destroyed (we call it getting &quot;popped&quot; from the stack), and <code>main()</code> resumes its process on the line stored in its frame.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="classes"><a class="header" href="#classes">Classes</a></h1>
<p>One of the key concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) is its use of classes. Implementing and using classes allows us to modularize our code, providing organization to large programs. Classes allow us to more easily write code that is reusable, debuggable, and extendible. Using classes, we can divide programs into separate parts that different people can work on simultaneously.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="classes-and-creating-objects"><a class="header" href="#classes-and-creating-objects">Classes and Creating Objects</a></h1>
<h2 id="motivation"><a class="header" href="#motivation">Motivation</a></h2>
<p>In python, a variable of type int, float, char, etc. can be used to store and reprsent one value.
But often one needs multiple values to represent one concept, or one object. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>a point in two-dimensional space is represented by two variables (x, y),</li>
<li>A rectangle has a center point, a width and a height,</li>
<li>a college registrar stores many pieces of information about each student (name, address, year in school, gpa, etc.)</li>
<li>a bouncing circle in an animation has an x-position, a y-position, a size, an x-velocity, a y-velocity, and a color</li>
</ul>
<p>We see the advantage of bundling the multiple variables that represent an object in the above examples. The x and y values for a point should be stored together, as should the multiple pieces of information about a college student's record, or information for a bouncing circle in an animation.</p>
<p>All high-level programming languages give you a way to package multiple variables into one object. In object-oriented languages (including python), the idea goes further. You can uses classes to package <strong>data</strong> together with the <strong>code</strong> that manages and manipulates that data.</p>
<p>Example: Suppose we want to write python code to store data for a rectangle, together with code to manage and manipulate that data. We would do this by implementing a class called <code>Rectangle</code>, and could specify it to store the variables <code>center_x</code>, <code>center_y</code>, <code>width</code>, and <code>height</code>. Variables that are part of a class are called <em>instance variables</em>. We would also specify it to have built-in functions to manage the rectangle, such as a function that would compute the area of the rectangle, or a function that would draw the rectangle. Functions that are part of a class are called <em>methods</em>.</p>
<p>The diagram below (a modified version of a UML diagram) shows the name of the class, the instance variables and their types, and the methods (with the parameter types and return value types):</p>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Rectangle</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Instance variables and their types:<br>
    <code>center_x:float</code><br>
    <code>center_y:float</code><br>
    <code>width:float</code>code><br>
    <code>height:float</code>code></td>
      ```
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>methods (along with their parameters and return types):<br>
    <code>__init__(center_x:float, center_y:float, width:float, height:float)  # constructor (initialization method)</code><br>
    <code>draw(None)->None                   # display the rectangle</code>  <br>
    <code>area(None)->float                  # compute and return the rectangle area</code><br>
    </tr> 
</table>
<p>Once the <code>Rectangle</code> class has been implemented (either by ourselves or by someone else), just knowing the above interface allows us to use the class, even without knowing details about how it is implemented. This illustrates the concept of <em>abstraction</em>. The complexity of the implementation is hidden from the user of the Rectangle class.</p>
<h2 id="objects"><a class="header" href="#objects">Objects</a></h2>
<p>In the above example, once the <code>Rectangle</code> class has been implemented, other programmers can use that class, trusting that it was implemented correctly, without bothering themselves with how it was implemented. Any programmer wanting to store information about a rectangle and potentially compute its area or display it, would create one <code>Rectangle</code> object for each rectangle they want to represent. Each <code>Rectangle</code> object is treated like a single variable. That single variable is made up of multiple components, namely a <code>center_x</code>, <code>center_y</code>, <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>, as well as some methods (functions) for manipulating that rectangle.</p>
<p>Think of the Rectangle class as a &quot;cookie cutter&quot; that we can use to create multiple &quot;cookies&quot; (rectangles).</p>
<h2 id="how-to-create-objects---example"><a class="header" href="#how-to-create-objects---example">How to create objects - example</a></h2>
<p>To create a new rectangle object, we state the name of the class, and pass the required initialization parameters. This calls the constructor (or initialization method).</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">rectangle1 = Rectangle(2, 3, 0.1, 0.2) # create a rectangle with center (2, 3), width 0.1, height 0.2
rectangle2 = Rectangle(4, 6, 0.15, 0.3) # create a rectangle with center (4, 6), width 0.15, height 0.3
</code></pre>
<p>The first line of code above creates (or <em>instantiates</em>) a new <code>Rectangle</code> object. This object has variable name <code>rectangle1</code>, and is a bundle of four instance variables (<code>center_x</code>, <code>center_y</code>, <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>). Note that the single line of code automatically creates 4 separate variables that are bundled together. The second line of code instantiates a second new <code>Rectangle</code> object. Again, a single line of code creates a bundle of 4 variables.</p>
<h2 id="using-or-invoking-methods"><a class="header" href="#using-or-invoking-methods">Using (or invoking) methods</a></h2>
<p>Once we have created an object, we can invoke the methods associated with it using the expression <code>object_name.method_name()</code>.
For example, the code below outputs the area of the object <code>rectangle1</code> that we instantiated above:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(rectangle1.area())
</code></pre>
<p>The next line of code displays <code>rectangle2</code> that we instantiated above:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">rectangle2.draw()
</code></pre>
<h2 id="accessing-the-data-elements-in-an-object"><a class="header" href="#accessing-the-data-elements-in-an-object">Accessing the data elements in an object</a></h2>
<p>The data for an object is stored in its instance variables. You can access these values with the expression <code>object_name.instance_variable_name</code>. The following  lines of code output the values stored in the rectangles we created above:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(f&quot;Center point of rectangle1: ({rectangle1.center_x}, {rectangle1.center_y})&quot;)
print(f&quot;width and height of rectangle2: width = {rectangle2.width}, height = {rectangle2.height}&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Note about object-oriented programming: in good object-oriented programming practice, users of a class should never modify the contents of the instance variables directly - rather the contents should be modified in the code internal to the class. Often this is done through <em>setter</em> methods (also called <em>mutators</em>).
In fact, in true object-oriented languages (such as C++ or Java), code that uses a class may not even <em>see</em> the contents of the instance variables directly - they must access them using <em>getter</em> methods (also called <em>accessors</em>).</p>
<h2 id="more-about-abstraction"><a class="header" href="#more-about-abstraction">More about abstraction</a></h2>
<p>Notice that in the examples above, we wrote code that uses a class (the <code>Rectangle</code> class ) just by knowing the interface of the class (described in the UML diagram shown above). We did so above without ever having seen the code that implements the class. Doing so relies on us confidently using the code written either by someone else or ourselves at a different time. By abstracting the data and functionality of the class, we're able to implement, debug and test the two parts of the code (i.e., implement the class, and then use the class) completely separately. Breaking the code into  separate units means we can implement very large programs by writing just parts of it at a time.</p>
<h2 id="strings-are-objects"><a class="header" href="#strings-are-objects">Strings are objects</a></h2>
<p>We've actually used classes before this. When you create a string in python, it is an object of the <code>str</code> class. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">name = &quot;Bessie Mae &quot;
print(name.count('e'))           # outputs the number of e's in name
lower_case_name = name.lower()   # name.lower() returns a new string object, with all letters now lower-case
first_name = name.split()[0]
</code></pre>
<p>In the code above, we are invoking three different methods from the <code>str</code> class (<code>count()</code>, <code>lower()</code>, and <code>split()</code>). Notice that <code>name.lower()</code> fits the pattern <code>object_name.method_name()</code>.
You can find the official python documentation listing all available methods in the <code>str</code> class here: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods">https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods</a></p>
<h2 id="summary-of-why-we-use-classes-and-objects"><a class="header" href="#summary-of-why-we-use-classes-and-objects">Summary of why we use classes and objects</a></h2>
<p>Programming with classes and objects:</p>
<ul>
<li>helps you to better organize complex code.</li>
<li>makes it easier to create reusable code.</li>
<li>results in code that is more maintainable.</li>
<li>enables you to break down large programs into subtasks that different people can implement.</li>
<li>creates encapsulation (compartmentalizes data so that one part of a program cannot corrupt data managed by another part of the program).</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="how-to-implement-a-class"><a class="header" href="#how-to-implement-a-class">How to implement a class</a></h1>
<p>The template for the simplest class looks like this:</p>

    # Every class has an __init__ method, called a constructor, or initializer.
    # Notice that __init__ takes &quot;self&quot; as a parameter, as does every method in a class.

    def __init__(self, pass initial values as parameter):
        pass

    def put_your_methods_here(self, put parameters here):
        pass
</code></pre>
<p>In python, classes are named using CamelCase (class name is capitalized, no spaces, each new word starts with a capital letter). Recall from the previous section the interface of the <code>Rectangle</code> class:</p>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Rectangle</td>

<p>For reference, in this section we will continue developing the <code>Rectangle</code> class created in the previous section:</p>

class Rectangle:

    def __init__(self, center_x:float = 0, center_y:float = 0, width:float = 1, height:float = 1):
        self.center_x = center_x

    # Compute and return area
    def area(self)-&gt;float:
        return self.width*self.height
</code></pre>
<p>The following line of code instantiates (creates) an object of type <code>Rectangle</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">rectangle1 = Rectangle(2, 3, 0.1, 0.2) # create a rectangle with center (2, 3), width 0.1, height 0.2
</code></pre>
<p>Now suppose we want to output the contents of rectangle to the terminal. Naturally, we would try the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(rectangle1)
</code></pre>
<p>Disappointingly, the output to the terminal might look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;__main__.Rectangle object at 0x100afbfd0&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>When we output the contents of the rectangle object to the terminal, python by default outputs the location in memory where
the object is stored. It does so because we have not included in the definition of the <code>Rectangle</code> class what format the output 
of a <code>Rectangle</code> object should look like. To fix this issue, we must include a method called <code>__str__</code> in the <code>Rectangle</code> class.
Its job is to build and return a string in the right format. If we have provided a <code>__str__</code> method, then python will automatically
look for and call that method when we ask it to print an object.  Here is the <code>__str__</code> method that we now include in the <code>Rectangle</code> class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">    # produce a string to represent this rectangle. Note that python will automatically call this method 
    # to produce a string whenever print(rectangle_object) is executed

<p>Let's use the class <code>Rectangle</code> that we implemented in the previous section. For reference, here is the code:</p>

    def __init__(self, center_x:float = 0, center_y:float = 0, width:float = 1, height:float = 1):

<h2 id="instantiating-creating-a-list-of-objects"><a class="header" href="#instantiating-creating-a-list-of-objects">Instantiating (creating) a list of objects</a></h2>
<p>We will now create 100 <code>Rectangle</code> objects with random centers, each with width and height of 0.02, and store them in a list. 
Please note how short and simple this code is! Create an empty list to store the rectangles. 
Then within a for loop, instantiate (create) a new <code>Rectangle</code> object, 
passing random values for the center, and 0.02 for the width and height. 
Then append that new rectangle to the list of rectangles.</p>

<h2 id="traversing-iterating-over-the-list-of-objects"><a class="header" href="#traversing-iterating-over-the-list-of-objects">Traversing (iterating over) the list of objects</a></h2>
<p>Now that all 100 of our rectangles are stored in one list, we can iterate over that list, doing whatever we want with
each rectangle. For example, the following code displays all 100 rectangles to a dudraw canvas:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># This content-based loop iterates over each rectangle, displaying it by calling its draw() method
for rectangle in rectangles:
    rectangle.draw()
dudraw.show(10000) # display for 10 seconds

<p>Note that the above loop could alternately have been implemented with an index-based loop:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">for i in range(len(rectangles)):
    rectangles[i].draw()
dudraw.show(10000)
</code></pre>
<p>As another example, here's a loop that calculates the total area of all of the rectangles:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">total_area = 0
for rectangle in rectangles:
    total_area += rectangle.area()
print(total_area)
</code></pre>
<p>Exercise for you: convert the above code to an index-based loop.</p>
<p>And a third example of iterating over a list of objects, here is a loop that outputs to the terminal the data stored in the <code>rectangle</code> list. 
On the second line, python automatically calls the <code>__str__</code> method we implemented in the <code>Rectangle</code> class.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">for i in range(len(rectangles)):
    print(rectangles[i])
</code></pre>
<p>Exercise for you: convert the above code to a content-based loop.</p>
<h2 id="a-quirk-of-python-when-printing-lists-of-objects"><a class="header" href="#a-quirk-of-python-when-printing-lists-of-objects">A quirk of python when printing lists of objects</a></h2>
<p>It would be very natural for you to think that the following line would output the contents of each rectangle in the list <code>rectangles</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(rectangles)
</code></pre>
<p>Since we have implemented <code>__str__</code>, it seems like <code>__str__</code> should be called for every element in the list we are outputting.
However, in python if we print our list of objects, the memory addresses of the objects get printed:</p>
<pre><code>[&lt;__main__.Rectangle object at 0x1024dcf10&gt;, &lt;__main__.Rectangle object at 0x10263df30&gt;, &lt;__main__.Rectangle object at 0x1032797e0&gt;,
&lt;__main__.Rectangle object at 0x104919900&gt;, &lt;__main__.Rectangle object at 0x104919960&gt;, &lt;__main__.Rectangle object at 0x1049199c0&gt;,
...
</code></pre>
<p>There is a way around this. When outputting a list of objects, python automatically calls the <code>__repr__</code> method, not the <code>__str__</code> method.
Let's implement the <code>__repr__</code> method in our <code>Rectangle</code> class (having it just call our existing <code>__str__</code> method).
Add this method to our <code>Rectangle</code> class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">    def __repr__(self)-&gt;str:
        return self.__str__()
</code></pre>
<p>Now when we execute the line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(rectangles)
</code></pre>
<p>we get our desired output:</p>
<pre><code>[center: (0.8229662378956932, 0.564174022001409), width: 0.02, height: 0.02, center: (0.16580614832245955, 0.17398244134557717), width: 0.02, height: 0.02,
center: (0.6660610136763881, 0.9802962789008293), width: 0.02, height: 0.02, center: (0.5937968938322629, 0.655517849943249), width: 0.02, height: 0.02,
...
</code></pre>
<p>In this course, we will always implement a <code>__repr__</code> method in every class we write.</p>
<p>Note: in python, there is another official purpose for <code>__repr__</code> methods, 
so in future work you might be required to have <code>__repr__</code> produce strings with a different format than <code>__str__</code>.</p>

<h1 id="a-more-complicated-class"><a class="header" href="#a-more-complicated-class">A more complicated class</a></h1>
<p>We will use the <code>Point</code> class above to make a class called <code>Triangle</code>. 
Since a triangle has three vertices, our <code>Triangle</code> objects will have three instance variables 
(<code>self.vertex1</code>, <code>self.vertex2</code>, and <code>self.vertex3</code>), each of which is themself an object, of type <code>Point</code>.
This nesting of classes is common in object-oriented classes. Trace carefully through the following code and
predict the output to the terminal.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Triangle:

    def __init__(self, v1: Point, v2: Point, v3: Point):
        self.vertex1 = v1
        self.vertex2 = v2
        self.vertex3 = v3

    def __str__(self)-&gt;str:

        self.vertex1.shift(shift_by)
        self.vertex2.shift(shift_by)
        self.vertex3.shift(shift_by)

# main code block:
p1 = Point(4, 1)
p2 = Point(7, 1)
p3 = Point(5, 2)
t1 = Triangle(p1, p2, p3)
print(t1)
t1.shift(Point(3, 4))
print(t1)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>Vertices: (4, 1) (7, 1) (5, 2)
Vertices: (7, 5) (10, 5) (8, 6)
</code></pre>
<p>The variable <code>t1</code> has three instance variables, each of which are points. 
For example, <code>t1.vertex1</code> represents the point (4, 1). Notice that since <code>t1.vertex</code> is a <code>Point</code>, 
we can actually access its two instance variables, with <code>t1.vertex.x</code> and <code>t1.vertex.y</code>. 
However, in object-oriented programming practice, by convention we never modify an
instance variable's instance variable. Instead, we rely on that class to do the modification. 
You can see an example of this in the code above: The <code>Triangle</code> class does not itself change the values of each vertex. 
Instead, it calls the <code>Point</code> class's <code>shift()</code> method
to modify the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> values of each of the three vertices.</p>

<p>Below we define and use the class <code>Polygon</code>. It has one instance variable, which is a list of its vertices
(each of which is a <code>Point</code> object). 
Notice that the methods in this class will often need to traverse through that list of vertices.
In the code below, you see these loops both in the <code>__str__()</code> method and the <code>shift()</code> method. Notice two different styles of iteration (looping through index or looping through content) are used, 
so you can see different options. Carefully trace the code and predict the output to the terminal.</p>

<p>Recall that each object of a class has its own copy of each <em>instance variable</em>. On the other hand, there is a way to create variables that are shared by every object of the class - these are called <em>class variables</em>.</p>
<p>Key differences between instance variables and class variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each object has its own copy of every instance variable. But there is only one value stored for a class variable, shared by all objects.</li>
<li>Instance variables are most commonly created within the <code>__init__</code> method of a class. On the other hand, class variables are created within the class, but <em>outside</em> of any method.</li>
<li>If an object makes changes to a class variable, that change is seen by every object (since the variable is shared).</li>
<li>To access an instance variable, we say <code>object_name.instance_variable_name</code>. But to access a class variable, we say <code>ClassName.class_variable_name</code>.</li>

    # speed of light in miles per second
    # (this is a class variable)
    speed_of_light = 186000

    def __init__(self, name, mass, age, distance):
        self.name = name
        # store the mass, unit is number of times the mass of our sun
        self.mass = mass
        # store the age, unit is billions of years
        self.age = age
        # store the distance from earth, in light-years
        self.distance = distance

    def __str__(self)-&gt;str:
        return f&quot;{self.name}, mass: {self.mass} times Sol, age: {self.age}x10^9 years, distance: {self.distance} l.y.&quot;

        # miles = light years * seconds per year * speed of light in miles/hour

print(f&quot;distance of {sirius.name} from earth: {int(sirius.distance_in_miles())} miles&quot;)
# Demonstration that clients of the Star class can access class variables
print(f&quot;The speed of light is {Star.speed_of_light} miles per second.&quot;)

<p>output:</p>
<pre><code>Alpha Centauri A, mass: 1.1 times Sol, age: 5.3x10^9 years, distance: 4.37 l.y.

distance of Alpha Centauri A from earth: 25633091520000 miles
distance of Sirius - the Dog Star from earth: 50444985600000 miles
The speed of light is 186000 miles per second.
</code></pre>
<p>What to notice in the above example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The variable <code>speed_of_light</code> is defined <em>within</em> the class <code>Star</code>, but outside of any method definition. This is how we know it is a class variable.</li>
<li>Since <code>speed_of_light</code> is a class variable, it is shared by all objects of the class. We use a class variable in this case to define a single constant that all objects of the class can access. (There are other uses of class variables - see below.)</li>
<li>Since class variables are conventionally accessed with <code>ClassName.class_variable_name</code>, all objects can access the class variable in this example with the expression <code>Star.speed_of_light</code>. </li>
<li>Look closely at the <code>distance_in_miles()</code> method of the <code>Star</code> class. This is where you see the use of the class variable <code>Star.speed_of_light</code>.</li>
<li>Notice that client code (the main code block) can also access class variables with <code>ClassName.class_variable_name</code>, as seen in the last line of the code, where <code>Star.speed_of_light</code> is output. Although viewing the values stored in a class variable from outside the class is legitimate, it is bad programming practice to modify class variables from outside the class, even though python allows it. Other object-oriented programming languages (C++, Java) have mechanisms for disallowing it.</li>
<li>Technical note: in python it is also possible to access class variables using the object name (i.e., <code>object_name.class_variable_name</code> rather than <code>ClassName.class_variable_name</code>. For example, in the above code, you can use the expression <code>self.speed_of_light</code> within the class definition, or <code>alphaA.speed_of_light</code> within the client code. However, this practice is strongly discouraged, since if you attempt to mutate (modify) the class variable with this notation, a new instance variable is created with that name rather than modifying the class variable. This causes unexpected side-effects. Thus, it is widely accepted as good python programming practice to always use the notation <code>ClassName.class_variable_name</code>.</li>

<p>Because class variables are shared, we can use them to track events that occur class-wide. For example, we can use a class variable to count how many objects of a class have been instantiated. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Widget:

    # The class variable Widget.count will keep track of how many Widget objects
    # have been instantiated
    count = 0

    def __init__(self, number):
        # create and initialize whatever instance variables are needed:
        self.number = number
        # This __init__ method gets called each time a Widget is instantiated, so by
        # updating the shared variable Widget.count, we can keep track of how many times
        # this __init__ method has been called, and thus how many Widget objects there are.
        Widget.count = Widget.count + 1

# main code block:
# instantiate three Widget objects. Each time, the __init__ method is
# called, so Widget.count gets incremented
widget1 = Widget(17)
widget2 = Widget(23)
widget3 = Widget(47)
# The next line outputs 3, since Widget's __init__ method got called 3 times
print(Widget.count)
</code></pre>
<p>In the above code, the class variable <code>Widget.count</code> keeps track of the number of times a <code>Widget</code> object was instantiated. Since instantiation always calls the <code>__init__</code> method, within that method we increment the class variable <code>Widget.count</code> to track the total number of <code>Widget</code> objects.</p>

<p>This time we will create another class variable to keep track of the total number of times any method within our class was invoked (called).

<p>Often it is important to give people or objects unique identification numbers. Examples of this in real life are Social Security numbers (no two individuals can share the same number) or student id numbers (every student at DU has a different 87-number). In python, one way to give every object of a class a unique id is to maintain a class variable that keeps track of the next available id to assign to each subsequent object. When an object is instantiated, in the <code>__init__</code> method, an instance variable is created to store that object's id and the next available id is stored there (the next available id being the value of the class variable). Next, still within the <code>__init__</code> method, the value of that class variable is incremented so that when the subsequent object is instantitated, its id will not collide with this or any previous object. In the example below, a class is used to represent financial transations. Each financial transaction is given its own unique transaction identification number.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class FinancialTransaction:

    # The class variable FinancialTransaction.next_unique_id keeps
    # track of next available id, which will be assigned to each new
    # FinancialTransaction object. The first id assigned is 20000
    next_unique_id = 20000

    def __init__(self, source, destination, amount):
        # routing number and account number of source of funds
        self.source = source
        # routing number and account number for deposit
        self.destination = destination
        # dollar amount of the transaction
        self.amount = amount
        # set the id number of this transaction to the next available number
        self.id = FinancialTransaction.next_unique_id
        # Update the next available id (since we just used up the current one)

<p>In this chapter we look at more details of implementing classes. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>class customization using &quot;dunder&quot; (double-underscore) methods,</li>
<li>understanding how variables store references to object,</li>
<li>drawing memory diagrams representing simple and complex class structures, and</li>
<li>copying references, shallow copying, and deep copying.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="variables-are-references-to-objects"><a class="header" href="#variables-are-references-to-objects">Variables are references to objects</a></h1>
<p>A variable that refers to an object is technically a reference. This means that the variable stores the memory address of the object itself (in other words, the location in your computer's memory where the full data for the object is stored). To see this in action, consider this implementation of the class <code>Point</code>, which has no <code>__str__()</code> method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from __future__ import annotations

class Point:

    def __init__(self, x, y):
        # initialize the values of the point (x, y)
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
    
    def __add__(self, other: Point)-&gt;Point:
        return Point(self.x+other.x, self.y+other.y)

    def __eq__(self, other: Point)-&gt;bool:
        return self.x==other.x and self.y==other.y
    
# main code block:
point1 = Point(3, 5)
point2 = Point(3, 5)
print(point1)
print(point2)
</code></pre>
<p>output:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;__main__.Point object at 0x100b1bfd0&gt;
&lt;__main__.Point object at 0x100b1be50&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Without the <code>___str__()</code> function to override the form of the output, python returns the contents of the variable, which is its memory address (shown in the above output as a hexadecimal number).</p>
<p>The number stored in the variable is a memory address. Examining the values stored <em>at that memory address</em>, we find the actual data associated with the object.  So the variable is a <em>reference</em> of where to find the actual contents of the object. We can represent this situation visually with this memory diagram:</p>
<img src="chapters/classes2/memory_diagram_1.png" alt="Memory diagram of references to Point objects" width = 350>
<p>It is awkward to write the values of the memory addresses themselves, in particular because without running the program, we do not even know what these memory addresses will be. Therefore, by convention we represent memory diagrams like the one above with arrows. The start of the arrow is <em>inside</em> the reference variable, and the arrow points to the part of the diagram where the data itself is held.</p>
<img src="chapters/classes2/memory_diagram_2.png" alt="Abstract diagram of references to Point objects" width = 350>
<p>We view these memory diagrams as equivalent, and we prefer the second version. The arrows make it clear that each variable is a reference to an object.</p>
<h2 id="the-python-id-function"><a class="header" href="#the-python-id-function">The python <code>id()</code> function</a></h2>
<p>Suppose we now implement the <code>__str__()</code> method in the <code>Point</code> class, as shown below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Point:

    def __init__(self, x, y):
        # initialize the values of the point (x, y)
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
    
    def __add__(self, other: Point)-&gt;Point:
        return Point(self.x+other.x, self.y+other.y)

    def __eq__(self, other: Point)-&gt;bool:
        return self.x==other.x and self.y==other.y
    
    def __str__(self)-&gt;str:
        return f&quot;({self.x}, {self.y})&quot;

# main code block:
point1 = Point(3, 5)
point2 = Point(3, 5)
print(point1)
print(point2)
</code></pre>
<p>output:</p>
<pre><code>(3, 5)
(3, 5)
</code></pre>
<p>Now that the <code>__str__()</code> has been implemented, when we output the object to the terminal, we no longer see the memory address. However, we can still find out the memory address where the object is stored by using the python <code>id()</code> function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(id(point1))
print(id(point2))
</code></pre>
<p>output:</p>
<pre><code>4306616272
4306615888
</code></pre>
<p>These are the memory addresses of where the objects are stored, in decimal.</p>
<p>Note that the two ids that are output are not the same. Even though <code>point1</code> and <code>point2</code> have the same values, they are distinct objects, stored in separate memory locations. Note that if we were to change the x or y values of one of the points, the other would not change, since they are separate objects.</p>
<h2 id="copying-references"><a class="header" href="#copying-references">Copying references</a></h2>
<p>Suppose we modify the main code block to the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># main code block:
point1 = Point(3, 5)
point2 = Point(3, 5)
point3 = point2
</code></pre>
<p>The last line in the above code is an assignment statement, that stores in <code>point3</code> the value found in <code>point2</code>. Since that value is a reference (a memory address), the result is to copy the memory address to <code>point3</code>. Here is a memory diagram showing the result of the assignment statement. Note that <code>point2</code> and <code>point3</code> store the same memory address, so they have the same id.</p>
<img src="chapters/classes2/memory_diagram_3.png" alt="Memory diagram including two references to the same object" width = 350>
<p>The abstract version of this diagram (using arrows instead of actual memory addresses) is below. The arrows make it more obvious that two variables are referring to the same object. There are only two different <code>Point</code> objects, since only two <code>Point</code> objects were instantiated.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="dunder-methods-methods-whose-name-starts-with-two-underscores"><a class="header" href="#dunder-methods-methods-whose-name-starts-with-two-underscores">Dunder methods (methods whose name starts with two underscores)</a></h1>
<p>In python, methods that start with two underscores are called <em>dunder</em> (double-underscore) methods. They are sometimes also referred to as <em>magic</em> methods. These methods have special significance, since they are automatically invoked by python in certain situtations. You've seen two examples of this already: the <code>__init__</code> function is automatically (or &quot;magically&quot;) invoked when you instantiate an object, and the <code>__str__</code> method is automatically invoked when you print an object. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Time24:
    &quot;&quot;&quot; A class that represents a time of day on a 24-hour clock
        Default time is 0 hours 0 minutes &quot;&quot;&quot;
    def __init__(self,h: int = 0, m: float = 0):
        # set up the instance variables. Note that this initialization
        # method does not do error checking on the values, and it should
        self.hours = h
        self.minutes = m

    # return a string formated as hour:minute. Since we're using
    # a 24-hour clock, it's 2 digits for both hours and minutes
    def __str__(self)-&gt;str:
        return f&quot;{self.hours:02d}:{self.minutes:02d}&quot;


time1 = Time24(12, 59)  # automatically calls __init__
print(time1)            # automatically calls __str__, outputs 12:59
</code></pre>
<p>Besides <code>__init__</code> and <code>__str__</code>, python has a long list of other dunder methods. We will learn the <em>rich comparison operators</em>, which allows us, whenever it makes sense, to compare two objects of a class using  the operators <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>==</code>, <code>!=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, and <code>&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>In the work below, we will use the following <code>Time24</code> objects:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">time1 = Time24(12, 7)   # instantiate time2 object, represents 12:07
time2 = Time24(2, 43)   # instantiate time2 object, represents 02:43
time3 = Time24(12, 7)   # instantiate time3 object, represents 12:07
default_time = Time24() # default time is 00:00
</code></pre>
<h2 id="using-the--operator-to-compare-two-objects"><a class="header" href="#using-the--operator-to-compare-two-objects">Using the == operator to compare two objects</a></h2>
<p>Notice that two of the <code>Time24</code> objects above (<code>time1</code> and <code>time2</code>) represent the same time of day. What do you think is output by the following line of code?</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(time1 == time3)
</code></pre>
<p>Are you disappointed to find out that the above line of code outputs <code>False</code>? By default, two objects evaluate as equal in python when they represent the identical object (stored in the same memory location). By default, python does not compare the <em>contents</em> of the objects to see if the <em>contents are the same</em>. But when dealing with objects, comparing the contents is often what we want to do. So python gives us a way to make the <code>==</code> comparison between objects compare the contents of the objects, according to a method we provide. This is called &quot;overloading the <code>==</code> operator&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-overload-the--operator"><a class="header" href="#how-to-overload-the--operator">How to overload the <code>==</code> operator</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Within the class, implement a method called <code>__eq__</code>. </li>
<li>The <code>__eq__</code> method defines in python code how to tell if two objects are equal.</li>
<li>The <code>__eq__</code> method is automatically (&quot;magically&quot;) called when you use <code>==</code> to compare two objects.</li>
<li>The <code>__eq__</code> method should return a <code>bool</code>.</li>
<li>In our example, we will say two <code>Time24</code> objects equal if and only if they have the same values for hour and the same values for minutes. </li>
<li>The <code>__eq__</code> method should take two parameters. The object on the
left side of <code>==</code> becomes <code>self</code>, and the object on the right side of the <code>==</code> becomes the second parameter, typically named <code>other</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Include this code in the <code>Time24</code> class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">    def __eq__(self, other)-&gt;bool:
        return self.hours == other.hours and self.minutes == other.minutes
</code></pre>
<p>Now the following line outputs <code>True</code>, as desired:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(time1 == time3). # automatically calls the __eq__ method from the Time24 class, time1 is self, time3 is other
</code></pre>

</code></pre>
<p>But here's the output:</p>
<pre><code>TypeError: '&lt;' not supported between instances of 'Time24' and 'Time24'
</code></pre>
<p>When objects in a class have a natural linear ordering, then it makes sense to compare them with the <code>&lt;</code> operator. To implement this in python, we provide a <code>__lt__</code> operator in our class. The <code>__lt__</code> method should return a boolean, and take two parameters. The <code>__lt__</code> method will automatically be called when the code <code>object &lt; object2</code> is evaluated, with <code>object1</code> becoming the parameter <code>self</code>, and <code>object2</code> becoming the parameter <code>other</code>. For example, here is an implementation of <code>__lt__</code> for our <code>Time24</code> class. Insert this code into the class.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">    def __lt__(self, other)-&gt;bool:
        if self.hours &lt; other.hours:
            return True
        elif self.hours &gt; other.hours:
            return False
        else:
            return self.minutes &lt; other.minutes
</code></pre>
<p>Here is some demo code to show you show to call</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(time1 &lt; time2)        # calls __lt__, outputs False (time2 is earlier in the day)
print(time1 &lt; time3)        # outputs True (they are equal, so time1 isn't less than time3)
print(default_time &lt; time2) # outputs True, midnight is earlier than any other time

</code></pre>
<h2 id="the-other-rich-comparison-operators"><a class="header" href="#the-other-rich-comparison-operators">The other rich-comparison operators</a></h2>
<p>The table below lists the names of the dunder methods to implement for each of the comparison operators.
| Operator | dunder method |
| -------- | ------- |
| <code>==</code> (equal to) | <code>__eq__(self, other)</code> |
| <code>!=</code> (not equal to) | <code>__ne__(self, other)</code> |
| <code>&lt;</code> (less than) | <code>__lt__(self, other)</code> |

| <code>&gt;</code> (greater than) | <code>__gt__(self, other)</code> |
| <code>&gt;=</code> (greater than or equal to) | <code>__ge__(self, other)</code> |</p>
<p>Notice that each operator is actually the negation of one of the other operators. For example, <code>&gt;=</code> is the negation of <code>&lt;</code>. You can use this to shorten your code. The following is the complete implementation of rich comparison operators for our <code>Time24</code> class:</p>

<h2 id="using-dunder-methods-to-overload-arithmetic-operators"><a class="header" href="#using-dunder-methods-to-overload-arithmetic-operators">Using dunder methods to overload arithmetic operators</a></h2>
<p>Suppose we have a class that it makes sense to do arithmetic with. For example, say I implement the <code>Point</code> class, where each point is a location in the (x, y) plane. In some contexts it is mathematically useful to add two points by separately adding their x and y coordinates. For example, (1, 3) + (6, 5) = (7, 8). Consider the following implementation of the <code>Point</code> class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Point:

    def __init__(self, x, y):
        # initialize the values of the point (x, y)
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __str__(self)-&gt;str:
        # format the string in (x, y) form
        return f&quot;({self.x}, {self.y})&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>We wish the following code would output (7, 8):</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">point1 = Point(1, 3)
point2 = Point(6, 5)
point3 = point1 + point2
print(point3)
</code></pre>
<p>But instead here's the output:</p>
<pre><code>TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'Point' and 'Point'
</code></pre>
<p>We can &quot;teach&quot; python how to add elements of our <code>Point</code> class by implementing the method <code>__add__</code> in our class. The <code>__add__</code> method will be automatically called when python evaluates the expression <code>point1 + point2</code>. It takes two parameters, <code>self</code> and <code>other</code>, where the first summand <code>point1</code> takes the role of <code>self</code>, and the second summand <code>point2</code> takes th role of <code>other</code>. The <code>__add__</code> method should create and return a new <code>Point</code>, whose values are the sums of the individual points. Here's the implementation, which is incorporated into the <code>Point</code> class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">    def __add__(self, other: Point)-&gt;Point:
        newx = self.x + other.x
        newy = self.y + other.y
        new_point = Point(newx, newy)
        return new_point
</code></pre>
<p>Now, the code</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">point1 = Point(1, 3)
point2 = Point(6, 5)
point3 = point1 + point2
print(point3)
</code></pre>
<p>outputs</p>
<pre><code>(7. 8)
</code></pre>
<p>Note: the <code>__add__</code> function could be condensed to one line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">    def __add__(self, other: Point)-&gt;Point:
        return Point(self.x+other.x, self.y+other.y)
</code></pre>

We can use the python <code>id()</code> function to find the memory address where the objects are stored.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Since <code>point1</code> and <code>point2</code> were instantiated separately, they refer to two different objects. These objects are stored at different memory locations, so their ids are different (even though their contents are the same). On the other hand, <code>point3</code> refers to the same object as <code>point2</code>, so they have the same id.</p>
<p>Python provides another way to determine if two variables refer to the same object, using the keyword <code>is</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(point1 is point2) # outputs False, because point1 and point2 have different ids (they refer to different objects)

print(point1 is point3) # outputs False, because point1 and point3 have different ids (they refer to different objects)
</code></pre>
<p>If rather than comparing identities, we want to determine if the contents of the objects are the same, recall that we learned to use <code>==</code>, which automatically calls the <code>__eq__()</code> method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(point1 == point2) # outputs True, because the x and y values for point1 and point2 are the same.
print(point2 == point3) # outputs True, because the x and y values for point2 and point3 are the same.

<p>The memory diagram below shows the state of the objects right before the code <code>p1.x += 1</code> executes:</p>

<p>After the line <code>p1.x += 1</code> executes, the instance variable <code>x</code> in object that <code>p1</code> refers to is changed:</p>
<img src="chapters/classes2/memory_diagram_6.png" alt="another memory diagram of two variables referring to the same Point objects" width = 350>
<p>But notice that <code>p1</code> and <code>p2</code> refer to the same object (they have the same identity, i.e., <code>p1 is p2</code> is <code>True</code>), so when we output <code>p2</code>, we see that same change reflected. Thus the output is <code>(5,1)</code>. Drawing a memory diagram helps us trace more carefully through the code.</p>

<p>Now let's instantiate a <code>Triangle</code> object, which is more complicated since it has instance variables that are themselves objects. These instance variables are themselves references.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># main code block
p1 = Point(4, 1)
p2 = Point(7, 1)
p3 = Point(5, 2)
t1 = Triangle(p1, p2, p3)
</code></pre>
<p>Here's a diagram showing the state of memory after the above code executes. Examine each box and arrow carefully. Notice in particular that each of the vertex instance variables refer to objects, so they each contain an error to points to a <code>Point</code> objects. Notice also that <code>p1</code>, <code>p1</code> and <code>p3</code> are part of the diagram, and they refer to the same <code>Point</code> objects as are stored in the <code>Triangle</code> <code>t1</code>.</p>

<p>Aided by the above memory diagram, trace through the following code, to be run after the main code block above, and predict its output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">p1.x = 10
t1.vertex3.y = 19
print(p3)
print(t1)
</code></pre>
<p>Answer:</p>
<pre><code>p3: (5, 19)
Vertices: (10, 1) (7, 1) (5, 19)
</code></pre>
<p>Since <code>p1</code> refers to the same object as <code>t1.vertex</code>, when <code>p1</code> is changed, so is <code>t1.vertex3</code>. Similarly, since <code>t1.vertex3</code> refers to the same object as <code>p3</code>, when <code>t1.vertex3</code> is changed, so is <code>p1</code>. Here is the final memory diagram showing the changes:</p>

<p>There are three levels of copying an object:</p>
<ul>
<li>copy a reference</li>
<li>shallow copy</li>
<li>deep copy</li>
</ul>
<p>In the explanations below, we will refer to the following classes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Point:

    def __init__(self, x, y):
        # initialize the values of the point (x, y)
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __str__(self)-&gt;str:
        # format the string in (x, y) form
        return f&quot;({self.x}, {self.y})&quot;
    
class Triangle:

    def __init__(self, v1: Point, v2: Point, v3: Point):

        self.vertex2 = v2
        self.vertex3 = v3

    def __str__(self)-&gt;str:

</code></pre>
<h2 id="copy-a-reference"><a class="header" href="#copy-a-reference">Copy a reference</a></h2>
<p>You've already seen the idea of copying a reference. Consider this code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">p1 = Point(4, 1)
p2 = p1
p1.x = 5
print(p2.x) # outputs 5
</code></pre>
<p>In the first line above, a <code>Point</code> object called <code>p1</code> is instantiated. Since <code>p1</code> is actually a reference to the <code>Point</code> object, the next line makes a copy of that reference. Thus <code>p1</code> and <code>p2</code> refer to the same object. In the third line, the <code>x</code> value of <code>p1</code> is changed. Since <code>p2</code> refers to the same object, on line 4, naturally <code>p2.x</code> also has the value 5.  Here is the memory diagram showing the situation:</p>
<img src="chapters/classes2/memory_diagram_5.png" alt="memory diagram of two variables referring to the same Point objects" width = 350>
<h2 id="shallow-copy"><a class="header" href="#shallow-copy">Shallow copy</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes we don't want to copy a reference, but instead we want to make a true copy of an object. The first way to do this in python is with a shallow copy, implemented in the <code>copy</code> function from python's <code>copy</code> module. To use this function, call <code>copy.copy(original_object)</code>, and it returns a new object of the same type, with each instance variable copied from the original. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import copy
original_point = Point(17, 23)
new_point = copy.copy(original_point)
original_point.y = 59
print(original_point)   # outputs (59, 23), it has been modified
print(new_point)        # outputs (17, 23), the copy was not modified
</code></pre>
<p>Here's the memory diagram right after the line <code>new_point = copy.copy(original_point)</code> is executed:
<img src="chapters/classes2/shallow_copy1.png" alt="Point object, along with its shallow copy" width = 350></p>
<p>Notice <code>new_point</code> is a copy of the original. It is a separate object, thought its values are the same, it has a different id. Thus, when the value of <code>original_point.y</code> is changed, this will not affect <code>new_point</code>. Here's the memory diagram after the line <code>original_point.y = 59</code> is executed:</p>
<img src="chapters/classes2/shallow_copy2.png" alt="Point object has been modified, and the copy is unchanged" width = 350>
<h2 id="a-shallow-copy-is-not-always-ideal-since-it-only-copies-one-level-of-depth"><a class="header" href="#a-shallow-copy-is-not-always-ideal-since-it-only-copies-one-level-of-depth">A shallow copy is not always ideal, since it only copies one level of depth</a></h2>
<p>Let's look what a shallow copy does on a more complex object:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Create Triangle object and a shallow copy of it
t1 = Triangle(Point(4, 1), Point(7, 1), Point(5, 2))
t2 = copy.copy(t1)   # shallow copy!
print(t1)            # outputs Vertices: (4, 1) (7, 1) (5, 2)
print(t2)            # outputs Vertices: (4, 1) (7, 1) (5, 2)
</code></pre>
<p>Let's examine in detail what happens with the shallow copy. Start with the memory diagram for <code>t1</code>:
<img src="chapters/classes2/shallow_copy3.png" alt="One triangle, before copy" width = 450></p>
<p>Recall that a shallow copy will copy each instance variable of an object. The three instance variables for <code>t1</code> are each references (<code>t1.vertex1</code>, <code>t1.vertex2</code>, and <code>t1.vertex3</code>). So all three of these references get copied to the new object <code>t2</code>. These copies of references do not create new objects. This means that <code>t1</code>s instance variables(<code>t2.vertex1</code>, <code>t2.vertex2</code>, and <code>t2.vertex3</code>) point to the same <code>Point</code> objects as <code>t1</code>. They share these objects!</p>
<img src="chapters/classes2/shallow_copy4.png" alt="Two triangles, after shallow copy" width = 450>
<p>The shallow copy works fine when we change one of the instance variables of the original object (i.e., replace one of the vertex <code>Point</code>s)</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Change the first vertex of t1 to a new Point object:
t1.vertex1 = Point(3, -1)
print(t1)  # The triangle has been modified to Vertices: (3, -1) (7, 1) (5, 2)
print(t2)  # still outputs Vertices: (4, 1) (7, 1) (5, 2)
</code></pre>
<p>The behavior still makes sense - the copied triangle does not change when the first triangle is modified. Here is the memory diagram after the above code has been executed. Notice that <code>t1.vertex1</code> now refers to a brand-new <code>Point</code>.</p>
<img src="chapters/classes2/shallow_copy5.png" alt="Two triangles, after shallow copy, modified instance variables" width = 450>
<p>But the behavior of the shallow copy really doesn't satisfy our needs in this case when we change values in the underlying <code>Point</code> objects:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">t1.vertex3.y = 0
print(t1)    # As expected, y value of last vertex is modified Vertices: (3, -1) (7, 1) (5, 0)
print(t2)    # t2 is a copy, yet the value of its last vertex also changed: Vertices: (4, 1) (7, 1) (5, 0)
</code></pre>
<p>Here is the memory diagram after the last segment of code has run. Notice that the y-coordinate of vertex3 has been modified, for both triangles.</p>
<img src="chapters/classes2/shallow_copy6.png" alt="Two triangles, after shallow copy, modified deeper" width = 450>
<p>We see that for objects with more than one level, a shallow copy can lead to unwanted side effects when changing values on the second level or deeper. To solve this problem, the python <code>copy</code> module provides a function called <code>deepcopy()</code>.</p>
<h2 id="deep-copy"><a class="header" href="#deep-copy">Deep copy</a></h2>
<p>A call to <code>copy.deepcopy(original_object)</code> returns an new object that is a copy of <code>original_object</code>. Any object that <code>original_object</code> refers to is also copied. This instantiation of copies happens at every level of depth of the object being copied.</p>
<p>For example, consider this code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">orig = Triangle(Point(1, 6), Point(5, 3), Point(1, 3))
copied = copy.deepcopy(orig)
</code></pre>
<p>Here's a memory diagram of the two objects after the deep copy:</p>
<img src="chapters/classes2/deep_copy.png" alt="Two triangles, after deep copy" width = 450>
<p>Notice that the three <code>Point</code>s representing the vertices of the original triangle all got copied.
The deep copy completely detaches connection between the two objects. So modifications made to one of the triangles cannot possibly affect the other triangle. For example, the code below swaps out a new point for <code>orig.vertex1</code>, and also changes an individual component of <code>orig.vertex3</code>. Neither of these affect the <code>copied</code> triangle.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">orig.vertex1 = Point(3, -1)
orig.vertex3.y = 0
</code></pre>
<img src="chapters/classes2/deep_copy_modified.png" alt="Two triangles, after deep copy and modification of one the original" width = 450>
<p>In the above memory diagram, <code>orig.vertex1</code> was changed to a newly-instantiated <code>Point</code>. This means that there are no longer any arrows pointing to the initial point <code>orig.vertex1</code>. Since there are no remaining references to this point, it can no longer be accessed from within this program. Python &quot;cleans up&quot; these orphaned objects through a process called <em>garbage collection</em>. Garbage collection recovers space in memory to potentially be used by python later in the running of the program.</p>
