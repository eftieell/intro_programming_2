<h2 id="development-environment"><a class="header" href="#development-environment">Development Environment</a></h2>
<p>In order to be able to write and execute Python programs, we will have you install two different pieces of software on your computer:</p>
<h3 id="python"><a class="header" href="#python">Python:</a></h3>
<p><img src="img/installation/installation_python_interpreter.png" alt="A console showing the Python interactive interpreter." /></p>
<p>This is the Python <strong><em>interpreter</em></strong> (or Python <em>executable</em>). This is the software that will actually read your Python code, and tell the computer how to execute it.</p>
<p>This is usually bundled with an extra piece of software (written in Python!) called '<strong>pip</strong>'. Pip is a package manager that is used to install and manage extra Python packages and libraries. It gives you easy access to more powerful tools that aren't necessarily included with Python from the get-go.</p>
<p>The interpreter is technically the only software you need to write and execute Python programs (and it is the most important!), but to make our lives easier we will also install...</p>
<h3 id="visual-studio-code"><a class="header" href="#visual-studio-code">Visual Studio Code:</a></h3>
<p><img src="img/installation/installation_vscode.png" alt="A screenshot of Microsoft Visual Studio Code" /></p>
<p>This is a code editor called Visual Studio Code (<strong>VSCode</strong>) -- not to be confused with Visual Studio, another Microsoft product.</p>
<p>Any Python program that you write will simply be a text file, but with a filename that ends in &quot;<strong>.py</strong>&quot; (instead of &quot;<strong>.txt</strong>&quot;, or &quot;<strong>.doc</strong>&quot; for example). Because of this, you can use any simple text editor to write the code if you want (for example Notepad.exe on Windows, or TextEdit.app on Mac -- but not Microsoft Word!).</p>
<p>Nowadays though, many programmers will use a special text editor that makes writing code easier by adding helpful tools like syntax highlighting, autocomplete suggestions, and executing/debugging programs - all from within the text editor!</p>
<p>VSCode is one of these -- it's just a special text editor with helpful features for working with code. A neat bonus is that, while we will be using it for Python exclusively in this class, VSCode also works with most other popular programming languages!</p>
<ul>
<li>Side-note: When enough features are bundled together in a code editor, and especially when that editor is specifically targeted towards one particular programming language, it is often called an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). VSCode is like our IDE in this case, although it doesn't have all the features that a true IDE might have - but that's okay, we won't need them for now.</li>
</ul>
<p>VSCode will also give us the ability to collaboratively write code together in real-time on separate computers!</p>

<h2 id="python-installation-and-setup"><a class="header" href="#python-installation-and-setup">Python Installation and Setup</a></h2>
<p>Visit the following page to download the latest official Python installer for your operating system:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">https://www.python.org/downloads/</a></p>
<p>The latest Python version will appear as 3.xx.xx, where xx is some version number. </p>
<p>Once you've downloaded the installer (<strong>.pkg</strong> for MacOS, or <strong>.exe</strong> for Windows) you can run it simply by double-clicking it.</p>
<p>For the most part, the installation process should be self-explanatory and you can just click through without changing any settings, though there is one extra consideration depending on your operating system:</p>
<p><strong>Windows:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When the installation begins, on the first screen you should see a checkbox at the bottom for the option to &quot;<strong>add Python to PATH</strong>&quot;. Make sure that box <strong>IS CHECKED</strong> (you DO want to add the Python executable to your system PATH!), before continuing with installation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MacOS:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After the installation is complete, go to your Applications folder and find the Python folder inside (probably named &quot;Python 3.xx&quot;). The installer program may even have opened this folder for you automatically. Inside that folder there should be a file named &quot;<strong>Update Shell Profile.command</strong>&quot;. Double-click on that file to add the Python executable to your system PATH. Some windows may be opened during this process. It's fine to close them.</li>
<li>You may be asked if you want to move the &quot;Python&quot; Installer to the Trash. You may say yes to this, since the installation is complete.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="visual-studio-code-installation-and-setup"><a class="header" href="#visual-studio-code-installation-and-setup">Visual Studio Code Installation and Setup</a></h2>
<h3 id="download-and-install-instructions"><a class="header" href="#download-and-install-instructions">Download and Install Instructions:</a></h3>
<p>Visit to the following page to download the official VSCode installer (on Windows you can also install it through the Microsoft App Store): <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">https://code.visualstudio.com/</a></p>
<p>You'll want to download the latest &quot;Stable&quot; build (which should be the default option for the download button). Continue through the default installation (no need to change any settings).</p>
<p>Then follow the instructions based on your operating system:</p>
<p><strong>Windows:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Double click on .exe file, accept the license agreement then click next.</li>
<li>Leave the default destination location unchanged and click next</li>
<li>Leave the &quot;Select Start Menu Folder&quot; location unchanged and click Next</li>
<li>Check &quot;Create a desktop icon&quot;, leaving the rest of the selections as-is, and click next.</li>
<li>Finally, click &quot;Install&quot;, and &quot;Finish&quot;, and the program will open.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MacOS:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/"></a> Double-click to unzip, then drag the file &quot;Visual Studio Code&quot; into the &quot;Applications&quot; folder on your mac. You can then drag it again, from the applications folder, to the dock to create a shortcut.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="setup-vscode"><a class="header" href="#setup-vscode">Setup VSCode:</a></h3>
<p>Once installation is done and before you open VSCode, create a new folder on Desktop or Documents named &quot;COMP1351&quot;.</p>
<p>Open VSCode and do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Optionally, go through any initial setup that it walks you through (choosing a theme, etc) or skip all of that for now.</li>
<li>When VSCode opens you will see the <strong>explorer</strong> pane on the left (see picture below). Click on <strong>Open Folder</strong>  and navigate to your &quot;COMP1351&quot; folder. Depending on where you saved your COMP1351 folder, and your operating system, at this point you might get a security popup asking you if &quot;you trust the author of the files in this folder&quot; so click yes<br />
<img src="img/installation/installation_vscodesetup1.png" alt="VSCode file explorer pane." /></li>
<li>Create a new text file (File -&gt; New Text File) or by clicking the &quot;new file&quot; button (see picture below). Name the file &quot;hello.py&quot; then press return. A new file will be created as in the picture below. Once you've created the file, you may see a popup in the lower-right corner of VSCode asking if you want to install the &quot;Recommended Python (see &quot;Extension&quot; notes below - you can install them now or in a moment).
<img src="img/installation/installation_vscodesetup2.png" alt="VSCode new file and new folder buttons." /></li>
<li>Copy/paste the following Python code into that text file:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(&quot;Hello world!&quot;)  
print(&quot;This is my first Python program!&quot;)
</code></pre>
<ol start="5">
<li>Save that file (File -&gt; Save, or Command-S on a Mac and Control-S on Windows).</li>
<li> Extensions.
<ul>
<li>If you have not already installed them, then install them now.</li>
<li>This will probably take you to another window in VSCode showing the extension info.</li>
<li>If you didn't get the recommended extensions popup, or have problems starting the installation, you can go to the Extensions tab on the left-hand panel and manually search for the official Microsoft &quot;Python&quot; extension:</li>
<li><img src="img/installation/installation_vscodesetup3.png" alt="Addon pane in VSCode." width="150"/><img src="img/installation/installation_vscodesetup4.png" alt="Python Extension in VSCode." width="200"/></li>
<li>After you're done installing the Python extension, go back your code by selecting the tab at the top with the filename you chose.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the bottom-right, you should see a part of the info bar that says &quot;Python&quot; and a version number next to it:
<img src="img/installation/installation_vscodesetup5.png" alt="Python version in bottom bar of VSCode." />
Make sure that version number matches the Python version you installed (for example 3.10.6). If it doesn't, click on the version number and then select the Python executable that you installed earlier.</li>
<li>You should also now see in the upper-right corner a triangular &quot;play&quot; button. Go ahead and click it to run your Python file!<br />
<img src="img/installation/installation_vscodesetup6.png" alt="VSCode run button." /></li>
<li>If everything is working, you should see a console come up at the bottom of your window, and at the end of the text in that console you should see the text &quot;Hello world!&quot; and &quot;This is my first Python program!&quot; (probably among other things).
<img src="img/installation/installation_vscodesetup7.png" alt="VSCode output pane." /></li>

<p>If you've gotten this far, congratulations! You have a working Python and VSCode installation! There just two more things to do before you're ready to go for this class:</p>
<h3 id="live-share-collaboration"><a class="header" href="#live-share-collaboration">Live Share Collaboration:</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>Go to the Extensions tab of VSCode (the icon on the left that looks like a 2x2 grid with a square popped out).</li>
<li>From there search for the &quot;Live Share&quot; extension. It will have an official Microsoft check-mark logo attached to it, so you know which one is the correct one.</li>
<li>Install it!</li>
<li>Now in the bottom-left of your VSCode window, you should see a &quot;Live Share&quot; button. You'll use this later in class to collaboratively write code with your group!</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="dudraw-graphics-library"><a class="header" href="#dudraw-graphics-library">dudraw Graphics Library:</a></h3>
<p>The <code>dudraw</code> graphics library is a software package written at DU, based on the original <code>stddraw</code> package written at Princeton. It is a simple package that will allow us to draw images and create animations in our python programs. Here's how to install it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make a new Python file (File -&gt; New File... -&gt; Python).</li>
<li>Copy/paste the following code into the file:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-python">import sys
import subprocess
subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, &quot;-m&quot;, &quot;pip&quot;, &quot;install&quot;, &quot;dudraw&quot;])
import dudraw
dudraw.set_canvas_size(400,400)
dudraw.filled_circle(0.5, 0.5, 0.25)
dudraw.show(10000)
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>Save the file somewhere (again, with a &quot;.py&quot; ending, maybe &quot;dudraw_test.py&quot;).</li>
<li>And then run it (again using the triangular &quot;run&quot; button).</li>
<li>If everything goes well, you should see a window appear with a black circle in it. It will close itself after 10 seconds. That's it!</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>If something went wrong in any of the steps above, try the videos in the preclass assignment. If those don't help, then please contact your instructor before the first class to get help with setting up.</strong></p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="your-first-python-program"><a class="header" href="#your-first-python-program">Your first python program.</a></h1>
<p>It is traditional in Computer Science for your first program in any language to output the phrase &quot;Hello, world!&quot; to the console. This is a way of checking that your IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is working completely.
In python, the bare-bones &quot;Hello, world!&quot; program is just one line. Our version will be longer, to illustrate some other important programming practices.</p>
<p>In the VSCode application, open the browswer window and create a new file called <code>hello.py</code>. It's important that the name you choose ends with <code>.py</code>, so that your IDE knows to interpret your file as a python program. Paste the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">&quot;&quot;&quot;
First python program, that outputs &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
File Name: hello.py
Date: 
Course: COMP1351
Assignment: first python program
Collaborators: 1351 Instructors
Internet Sources: None
&quot;&quot;&quot;

def main():
    # Here's the guts of the program, just one line:
    print(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;)

# Run the program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</code></pre>
<p>Key points to notice and remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the <code>print()</code> function to output to the console. Put the text you want to output inside of the parentheses. Text in python (called a <em>string literal</em>) is enclosed either within double quotes (&quot;text&quot;) or single quotes ('text').</li>
<li><em>Comments</em> in a computer program are lines that python itself ignores. Comments are there for the benefit of humans (including your future self) reading your program. There are two kinds of comments in python: <em>block comments</em> and <em>in-line comments</em>. </li>
<li>You can see that the first 9 lines of this program is a block comment, since it is enclosed between lines of three double-quotes. Every python program that you turn in this quarter will start with a block comment giving your name, the purpose of the program, the name of the file it is stored in, the date, the course it is for, the assignment it is fulfilling, your collaborators, and any internet sources you used.</li>
<li>An inline comment starts with a <code>#</code>-sign. Anything on the line after a <code>#</code> is a comment that python ignores. Placing in-line comments in your code to explain your thought process while writing the code is an essential part of writing good code. Write the comments either before or during the coding process, <strong>not after</strong>.</li>
<li>The lines</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python">def main():
    # Here's the guts of the program, just one line:
    print(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>define the main function of the program. This function has one comment, and one line of executable code.</p>
<ul>
<li>At the end of the program, the lines</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python">if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

<h2 id="what-can-you-do-with-dudraw"><a class="header" href="#what-can-you-do-with-dudraw">What can you do with <code>dudraw</code>?</a></h2>
<p>The python package <code>dudraw</code> is a minimal graphics library developed for teaching a beginning python programming class. Its starting point was <code>stddraw</code>, developed at Princeton University (see <a href="https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/python/code/index.php#programs">Elements of Programming in Python</a>). At the University of Denver we modified and enhanced that package to produce <code>dudraw</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>dudraw</code> package has graphics primitives for drawing points, lines, circles and ellipses, squares and rectangles, triangles, quadrilaterals, polygons, circular and elliptical sectors, annuli and text. You can set the color you want the objects to be, and the width of points, lines and outlines.</p>
<p>You can find out about key-clicks and mouse presses from the user, and respond to them within your program. You can clear the background or use an image from a file as your background. You can save the image you produce to a file.</p>
<p>The <code>dudraw</code> package is a paint-style graphics package. In other words, you draw graphical objects, but they cannot be moved or deleted after being drawn.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-get-access-to-dudraw"><a class="header" href="#how-do-i-get-access-to-dudraw">How do I get access to <code>dudraw</code>?</a></h2>
<p>If you have not already installed <code>dudraw</code> through the instructions in class, then you can install it by running</p>
<p><code>pip install dudraw</code></p>
<p>Then if start your python program with the line</p>
<p><code>import dudraw</code></p>
<p>you will be able to call any of the functions in <code>dudraw</code></p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-use-dudraw"><a class="header" href="#how-do-i-use-dudraw">How do I use <code>dudraw</code>?</a></h2>
<p>Begin by creating a canvas of a specified size (in pixels), then issue graphics commands. When you are done, call the <code>show()</code>function and a window will appear with the image you have created. Unless you set the scale, the default scale is from 0 to 1 on the x-axis and 0 to 1 on the y-axis. Here's a simple program, and the image it produces.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import dudraw

# open a square window, parameters are width and height, in pixels
dudraw.set_canvas_size(200,200)

# fill the canvas with the given color
dudraw.clear(dudraw.LIGHT_GRAY)

# once the pen color is set, that is the color used until it is changed again
dudraw.set_pen_color(dudraw.DARK_GREEN)

# draw a triangle with vertices (0, 0), (1, 0) and (0.5, 0.7)
dudraw.filled_triangle(0, 0, 1, 0, 0.5, 0.7)
dudraw.set_pen_color(dudraw.YELLOW)

# Draw a circle with center at (0.8, 0.75), with a radius of 0.1
dudraw.filled_circle(0.8, 0.75, 0.1)

# Display the canvas
dudraw.show()

<h2 id="how-do-i-get-more-colors"><a class="header" href="#how-do-i-get-more-colors">How do I get more colors?</a></h2>
<p>This is a list of the colors pre-defined in dudraw:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">dudraw.WHITE
dudraw.BLACK
dudraw.RED
dudraw.GREEN
dudraw.BLUE
dudraw.CYAN
dudraw.MAGENTA
dudraw.YELLOW
dudraw.DARK_RED
dudraw.DARK_GREEN
dudraw.DARK_BLUE
dudraw.GRAY
dudraw.LIGHT_GRAY
dudraw.ORANGE
dudraw.VIOLET
dudraw.PINK
dudraw.BOOK_BLUE
dudraw.BOOK_LIGHT_BLUE
dudraw.BOOK_RED
</code></pre>
<p>To create colors of your own, first note that a color on a computer monitor can be defined by an intensity for red light, green light and blue light, each of which is an integer value from 0 to 255. Colors on a compter monitor are additive like light, rather than subtractive like paint. For example, to create yellow light, you add together green light and red light. So the brightest yellow is defined by red=255, green = 255, blue = 0. You can play around with choosing colors with many different programs. On many browsers, if you do an internet search on &quot;color picker&quot; one will show up. Or there are many free ones available on websites, for example here: <a href="https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/">color picker website</a>.
For example, here's a nice plum color, with values r = 140, g = 40, b = 160:</p>
<img src="img/dudraw_quickstart/plum_color.png" alt="a swatch with a plum color" width="75"/>
<p>Here's a way to make your background this color, or to set your pen color to this color:</p>

<p>By default, the scale in a dudraw canvas is [0, 1] x [0, 1], even if the size of the canvas itself is not square. For example, the code below produces the image shown. (The image is annotated to show the coordinates of a few points)</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import dudraw

dudraw.set_canvas_size(600,400)
dudraw.clear(dudraw.LIGHT_GRAY)

<p>But sometimes you might prefer to set the scale to match the pixels, or some other scaling. This is often useful if the canvas is not square. Here's the code to produce a nearly identical drawing, with the scale on the x-axis and y-axis set to be different from each other, and to have one unit be the size of one pixel. The canvas was created with a width of 600 pixels and a height of 400 pixels. The x-scale is set to go from 0 to 600, while the y-scale is set to go from 0 to 400. Notice that each graphics primitive was modified to reflect the change of scale. The image below is annoted to show how the scale on the axes works.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import dudraw

<h2 id="how-do-i-create-an-animation"><a class="header" href="#how-do-i-create-an-animation">How do I create an animation?</a></h2>
<p>Animation is usually created with a while loop. The following template shows what usually goes in the body of the while loop:</p>
<ul>
<li>clear the background</li>
<li>redraw the next frame of the animation</li>
<li>call <code>dudraw.show(wait_time)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>When you pass a parameter to <code>dudraw.show()</code>, the program pauses for the given wait_time, which is a <code>float</code> value giving the time in milliseconds.</p>
<p>Here is sample code that animates a circle appearing to move from the lower left corner of the canvas to the upper right corner:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Simple demo program of animation
# Animate a circle moving diagonally across the canvas
import dudraw

# (x, y) is the position of the center of the circle

y = 0 

# animation loop:

    # clear the background to prepare for the next frame
    dudraw.clear(dudraw.GRAY)
    # Update circle to the new position.
    x = x + 0.01
    y = y + 0.01
    # Draw circle at curent position, radius is a constant 0.05
    dudraw.filled_circle(x, y, 0.05)
    # Display the next frame, and pause 20 milliseconds
    dudraw.show(20)

<p>There are three <code>dudraw</code> methods for handling mouse ineraction
The function <code>dudraw.mouse_pressed()</code> returns a boolean, True if the mouse was pressed. It is typically used within an animation loop.
You can find out the position of the mouse (regardless of whether the mouse is pressed) by calling <code>dudraw.mouse_x()</code> and <code>dudraw.mouse_y()</code>. Each returns a float with the current position of the mouse. The position of the mouse is relative to the scale that has been set. Here's a sample program showing mouse interaction. Each time the mouse is pressed, a small circle on the canvas at the mouse position.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">#--------------------------------
# demo of mouse presses in dudraw
#--------------------------------
import dudraw

dudraw.set_canvas_size(500,500)

# animation loop
while True:
    # when mouse is pressed, draw a circle of radius 0.02 at the mouse location
    if dudraw.mouse_pressed():
        dudraw.filled_circle(dudraw.mouse_x(), dudraw.mouse_y(), 0.02)

<p>Polling for a key click typically happens within an animation loop. You must first call <code>dudraw.has_next_key_typed()</code>, which returns a boolean indicating whether the user has typed a key (or perhaps more than one). If the method returns <code>True</code>, then you can make a call to <code>dudraw.next_key_typed()</code>, which will return a string containing the next most-recently entered key. As an example, the following code is a modification of the mouse interaction code, with the added feature of quiting when the 'q' key is typed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">#-------------------------------------------------
# demo of mouse presses and key presses in dudraw

    if dudraw.mouse_pressed():
        dudraw.filled_circle(dudraw.mouse_x(), dudraw.mouse_y(), 0.02)
    # pause for 200th of a second

<h2 id="how-do-i-save-my-image-in-a-file"><a class="header" href="#how-do-i-save-my-image-in-a-file">How do I save my image in a file?</a></h2>
<p>Use the <code>dudraw.save()</code> function. You can output either .png files or .jpg files. The extension you use in the file name determines what file type is output.
Here's an example of a program that draws a very simple picture, and saves the output to two files, one .png and one .jpg:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">#-----------------------------------
# demo of saving to a file in dudraw
#-----------------------------------
import dudraw

# draw a red circle on a field of white
dudraw.set_canvas_size(300,300)
dudraw.set_pen_color(dudraw.RED)
dudraw.filled_circle(0.5, 0.5, 0.25)
dudraw.save(&quot;red_circle.jpg&quot;)
dudraw.save(&quot;red_circle.png&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that this program does not have a call to <code>dudraw.show()</code>. This means that, although the image is saved to both files, a window displaying the image is never opened, and the image is not displayed to the screen.</p>

<ul>
<li>The purpose of a <em>variable</em> is to store information within a program while it is running.</li>
<li>A variable is a named storage location in computer memory. Use the name to access the value.</li>
<li>To store a value in a variable, use the <code>=</code> operator (called the assignment operator).</li>
<li>An <code>=</code> sign in python is nothing like an equal sign in mathematics. Think of it more like an arrow going from right to left. The expression on the right is evaluated and then stored in the variable named on the left.</li>
<li>For example, the line of code
<code>hourly_wage = 16.75</code>
stores the value 16.75 in the variable called <code>hourly_wage</code></li>
<li>You can change the value of a variable with another assignment statement, such as 
<code>hourly_wage = 17.25</code></li>
<li>Every value has a type (<code>int</code> for integers, <code>float</code> for decimals, <code>str</code> for text). In python, when you store a value in a variable (with <code>=</code>), that variable then automatically has a type. For example, after the above assignment, <code>hourly_wage</code> is of type <code>float</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rules-and-conventions-for-naming-variables-in-python"><a class="header" href="#rules-and-conventions-for-naming-variables-in-python">Rules and conventions for naming variables in python</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The first character must be a letter or an underscore. For now, stick to letters for the first character.</li>
<li>The remaining characters must be letters, numbers or underscores.</li>
<li>No spaces are allowed in variable names.</li>
<li>Legal examples: <code>_pressure</code>, <code>pull</code>, <code>x_y</code>, <code>r2d2</code></li>
<li>Invalid examples, these are NOT legal variable names: <code>4th_dimension</code>, <code>%profit</code>, <code>x*y</code>, <code>four(4)</code>, <code>repo man</code></li>
<li>In python, it's a conventiion to use <em>snake case</em> to name variables. This means that we use all lower-case letters and we separate words in the variable name with underscores. Examples include <code>age</code>, <code>x_coordinate</code>, <code>hourly_wage</code>, <code>user_password</code></li>
<li>If the value stored in a variable is a true constant (in other words, its value will never change throughout the program), then we use all capital letters: <code>COURSE_ENROLLMENT_LIMIT</code>, <code>MAX_PASSWORD_ATTEMPTS</code>.</li>
<li>For high quality code, it is crucial that you choose names for variables that are descriptive. The variable names must help the reader of your program to understand your intention.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each variable has a name, a value, and a type. Types are necessary because different kinds of data are stored differently within the computer's memory. For now, we will learn three different types, for storing signed (positive or negative) whole numbers, signed decimals, and text.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th><th>Examples</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Numerical type</td><td><code>int</code></td><td>Signed integer that stores whole numbers (no decimal)</td><td>0, 7, -5</td></tr>
<tr><td>Numerical type</td><td><code>float</code></td><td>Signed decimal value</td><td>0.5, 20.0, -18.2, 2.5e3 = 2.5x10^3</td></tr>
<tr><td>String type (Text)</td><td><code>str</code></td><td>Any number of characters surrounded by &quot;&quot; or ''</td><td>&quot;Hello&quot;, 'world', '9'</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<h2 id="creating-a-variable-with-an-assignment-operator"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-variable-with-an-assignment-operator">Creating a variable with an assignment operator</a></h2>
<p>A variable is created or declared when we assign a value to it using the assignment operator <code>=</code>. In python, the code looks like this:
<code>variable_name = &lt;value&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># The next line stores an int value of 200 in the variable named age
age = 200
# The next line stores a float value of 7.5 in the variable named height
height = 7.5
# The next line stores a string (text) value of 'Chewbacca' in the variable named age
name = 'Chewbacca'
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the left hand side of an assignment must be a variable name. Non-example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># The following line is an error, don't do this!
7.5 = height
</code></pre>
<p>After creating a variable, you can change the value stored in a variable with another assignment operator at any time. This is called <em>reassignment</em>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">age = 201
</code></pre>
<h2 id="finding-out-the-type-of-a-variable-or-value"><a class="header" href="#finding-out-the-type-of-a-variable-or-value">Finding out the type of a variable or value</a></h2>
<p>The <code>type()</code> function in python will return the type of either a variable or a value. Here's an example that shows how to use it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">x = 5
print(type(x))
print(type(&quot;Wow!&quot;))
print(type(3.14159))
</code></pre>
<p>The output of the above code will be:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;class 'int'&gt;
&lt;class 'str'&gt;
&lt;class 'float'&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="casting-changing-the-type-of-a-variable-or-value"><a class="header" href="#casting-changing-the-type-of-a-variable-or-value">Casting (changing the type) of a variable or value</a></h2>
<p>You can change the type of a value (called “casting”) using the <code>int()</code>, <code>float()</code> and <code>str()</code> functions. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>int(23.7)</code> (truncates the float value 23.7 to the int value 23. This is different from rounding - the decimal part is discarded, regardless of whether it is larger or smaller than 0.5.</li>
<li><code>float(23)</code> (outputting the result will give 23.0 rather than 23)</li>
<li><code>str(23)</code> (converts the integer 23 to the text &quot;23&quot;)</li>
<li><code>int(&quot;23&quot;)</code> (converts the string &quot;23&quot; into a numerical integer value 23)</li>
<li><code>float(&quot;23&quot;)</code> (converts the string &quot;23&quot; into a numerical decimal value 23.0)</li>
<li><code>int(&quot;23.5&quot;)</code> results in an error</li>
<li><code>float(&quot;hello&quot;)</code> results in an error</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="doing-arithmetic-in-python"><a class="header" href="#doing-arithmetic-in-python">Doing arithmetic in python</a></h2>
<p>Here are the basic arithmetic operators in python. In these examples, assume</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">x = 11
y = 4
</code></pre>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Operator</th><th>Description</th><th>Syntax</th><th>Output</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><code>+</code></td><td>Addition</td><td><code>x+y</code></td><td><code>15</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>*</code></td><td>Multiplication</td><td><code>x*y</code></td><td><code>44</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>-</code></td><td>Subtraction</td><td><code>x-y</code></td><td><code>7</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>/</code></td><td>Decimal division (type is a <code>float)</code></td><td><code>x/y</code></td><td><code>2.75</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>//</code></td><td>Integer division (result of division is truncated, giving an <code>int</code>)</td><td><code>x//y</code></td><td><code>2</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>%</code></td><td>Modulus (remainder when first operand is divided by the second)</td><td><code>x%y</code></td><td><code>3</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>**</code></td><td>Exponentiation (raises the first  to the power of the second )</td><td><code>x**y</code></td><td><code>14641</code></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Another example of integer division and modulus: When we divide 3 by 4, we get a quotient of 0 and a remainder of 3. So <code>3//4</code> results in 0 and <code>3%4</code> results in 3.</p>
<p>Warning note: In python, <code>^</code> is <strong>not</strong> an exponent!</p>
<h2 id="order-of-operations"><a class="header" href="#order-of-operations">Order of operations</a></h2>
<p>The order of operations in python is similar to the order you are familiar with in math:
parentheses, then exponentiation, then multiplication/division/modulus in order from left to right, then addition/subtraction in order from left to right.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="getting-input-from-the-user-into-the-program"><a class="header" href="#getting-input-from-the-user-into-the-program">Getting input from the user into the program</a></h2>
<p>Use the <code>input()</code> function to ask the user of your program for a value. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">username = input(&quot;Enter your name: &quot;)
print(&quot;Hello,&quot;, username)
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the parameter within the parentheses of the <code>input()</code> function is the string that you want to display to the user as a message. That message is called a prompt, and it gets output to the console as part of the <code>input()</code> line. In other words, you don't need a separate <code>print()</code> statement. Make sure the prompt clearly communicates to the user what information you are asking them to enter. Once they type the value and hit the <code>&lt;return&gt;</code> key,
the <code>input()</code> function returns the value they entered. In the above example, the user's response is stored in a variable called <code>username</code>.
Here's a sample run of the above program:</p>
<pre><code>Enter your name: Sam
Hello, Sam
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the <code>input()</code> function always returns a string (of type <code>str</code>). To clarify,</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">username = input(&quot;Enter your name: &quot;)
print(type(username))
</code></pre>
<p>will output</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">&lt;class 'str'&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>But often we want the user to input a numerical value rather than a string (text) value. In this case we must <em>cast</em> the result to convert it to a numerical type. This is mandatory any time you want to do arithmetic with the number the user enters. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">user_age = input(&quot;Enter your age: &quot;)
user_age = int(user_age)
print(&quot;Next year you will be&quot;, user_age + 1)
</code></pre>
<p>Sample run of the above program:</p>
<pre><code>Enter your age: 19
Next year you will be 20
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the casting can actually be done on the same line as the input. The <code>input()</code> function returns a string, which we can immediately cast using the <code>int()</code> function. The two lines below behave identically to the three lines of code just above.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">user_age = int(input(&quot;Enter your age: &quot;))
print(&quot;Next year you will be&quot;, user_age + 1)
</code></pre>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="data-science"><a class="header" href="#data-science">Data Science</a></h1>
<p>Python is becoming an increasingly popular choice for many applications, but in particular it has become one of the standards in the field of Data Science.</p>
<p>Because of its popularity and applicability to this field, let's explore a few fundamental techniques for working with existing datasets and how Python can help make our lives easier!</p>
<h2 id="tabular-data"><a class="header" href="#tabular-data">Tabular Data</a></h2>
<p>First, let's focus on a common data format known as &quot;tabular data&quot;. This just means data that is best represented as a table. A relatable way of thinking about this kind of data might be an Excel spreadsheet that represents a collection of &quot;items&quot; of the same type. Each row represents one &quot;item&quot;, and each column is an attribute of that &quot;item&quot;:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Name</strong></th><th><strong>Age</strong></th><th><strong>Favorite Icecream</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Bob</td><td>24</td><td>Chocolate</td></tr>
<tr><td>Alice</td><td>31</td><td>Vanilla</td></tr>
<tr><td>John</td><td>48</td><td>Strawberry</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>For example, this a sheet of &quot;people&quot;, where each row is a &quot;person&quot;, and each column is an attribute of that person.</p>
<p>There are many different ways of working with tabular data (storing it, reading it, modifying it, analyzing it) and we're going to focus on one that will let us explore and use the data structures we're already familiar with.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="csv-comma-separated-values"><a class="header" href="#csv-comma-separated-values">CSV (Comma-Separated Values)</a></h2>
<p>The simplest way of representing a table is to just put it in a text file. Even for this, there are many ways you could choose to do it, but probably the most common way is using comma-separated-values (CSV).</p>
<p>Each row of text will represent one item, where the attributes of that item are separated by commas. Typically, the first row of text in the file will be the names of the columns (attributes):</p>
<pre><code>name,age,fav_icecream
Bob,24,chocolate
Alice,31,vanilla
John,48,strawberry
</code></pre>
<p>Note: sometimes this can be hard to read visually due to the mis-alignment of columns. If you're using VSCode (or something similar) you can install add-ons that color your CSV to make the columns clearer (or add spacing to align them).</p>
<p>Since a .csv file is just a text file, we can read it as we would normally read any text file in Python (with the open() function). But turning that text into other data structures (lists/dictionaries) is so common that Python has a built-in CSV reader!:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import csv

with open('mydata.csv') as csvfile:
    rows = csv.reader(csvfile)
    for r in rows:
        print(r)
        # r is a list of the values
        # [value1, value2, ...]
</code></pre>
<p>So in one go, we've turned the CSV file full of text into a <strong>list of lists</strong>, containing our data!</p>
<p>NOTE: You can also read files with separators other than a comma:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">rows = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=';')
</code></pre>
<p>The CSV format is more general than the specific use-case we're talking about here (tabular data) - it's really just a way of storing lists of values in rows! For the specific use-case of tabular data (i.e. items in rows, with attributes in columns, and a starting row of column names) there's a specific tool that we'll use from the csv module:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">with open('mydata.csv') as csvfile:
    # here's the magic step:
    rows = list(csv.DictReader(csvfile))
    for r in rows:
        print(r)
        # r is now a dictionary!
        # { column_name: attribute, ... }
</code></pre>
<p>So now, we've turned our text (CSV) representation of a table... into a <strong>list of dictionaries</strong>!!! Each dictionary represents one full &quot;Person&quot;, with all of their attributes. It looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">[
    { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Bob&quot;,
      &quot;age&quot;: 24,
      &quot;fav_icecream&quot;: &quot;chocolate&quot; },
    { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Alice&quot;,
      &quot;age&quot;: 31,
      &quot;fav_icecream&quot;: &quot;vanilla&quot; },
    { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;John&quot;,
      &quot;age&quot;: 48,
      &quot;fav_icecream&quot;: &quot;strawberry&quot;}
]
</code></pre>
