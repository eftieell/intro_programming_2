<p>This is the on-line textbook used at the University of Denver for the second-quarter Introduction to Programming 2 course (COMP 1352). This course is a continuation of the preceding quarter (Introduction to Programming 1, COMP 1351). This book is written to teach programming in python, and relies on <code>dudraw</code>, a simple in-house graphics package that extends Princeton's <code>stddraw</code>. Instructions on software installation can be found in the on-line textbook for COMP 1351, which you can find at <a href="https://cs.du.edu/~intropython/intro-to-programming/">Introduction to Programming 1</a>.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="review-of-producing-animations-using-the-dudraw-graphics-package"><a class="header" href="#review-of-producing-animations-using-the-dudraw-graphics-package">Review of producing animations using the dudraw graphics package</a></h1>
<p>The present section reviews how to animate drawings using the <code>dudraw</code> package, assuming you already know how to create simple drawings using <code>dudraw</code>.
Basic information about creating static drawings using <code>dudraw</code> can be found in a section of the COMP 1351 text here: <a href="https://cs.du.edu/~intropython/intro-to-programming/dudraw_quickstart.html">dudraw basics</a>.</p>
<p>Here is the typical outline of a <code>dudraw</code> animation program:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import dudraw

def main():
    # set up the dudraw canvas

    # initialize the attributes of object you are animating (position, size, etc.)

    # main animation loop (infinite loop, later we will give a way for users to quit)
    while True:
        # clear background

        # redraw the next frame

        # display the frame and pause

        # Prepare for next frame by advancing the attributes of the animated object(s)
        #  (move position, change size, etc.)

        # Check for user input (key presses or mouse presses)


if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    main()

</code></pre>
<p>Check for key presses by using <code>dudraw.next_key()</code>, which returns the associated character(s) for the next key (if there was a key press), and returns an empty string (<code>''</code>) if no key has been pressed since the most recent query.</p>
<p>Check for mouse clicks using <code>dudraw.mouse_clicked()</code>. Sometimes you may need to recognize if the mouse is currently pressed and not yet released (so you can process dragging of the mouse). Then use <code>dudraw.mouse_is_pressed()</code>. Occasionally you may also need the supporting functions <code>dudraw.mouse_dragged()</code> and <code>dudraw.mouse_released()</code>.</p>
<p>Here's a simplest example of an animation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import dudraw

# Animates a circle moving to the upper right.
# Quits when user types 'q'. When mouse is clicked,
# the circle's position sets to the clicked position.
def main():
    # set up the dudraw canvas
    dudraw.set_canvas_size(400, 400)
    # no call to dudraw.set_x_scale() or dudraw.set_y_scale()
    # means we are accepting the default of x in [0, 1] and y in [0, 1]
    # Since the canvas is 400x400 pixels, this means one pixel is 0.0025 units wide

    # initialize the position of the circle
    x = 0.1
    y = 0.5

    key = ''
    # main animation loop (infinite loop, quits when user enters 'q' or 'Q'
    while key.lower() != 'q':
        # clear background
        dudraw.clear(dudraw.LIGHT_GRAY)

        # redraw the next frame. The circle has a radius of 10 pixels.
        dudraw.filled_circle(x, y, 0.025)

        # display the frame and pause (20 milliseconds = 50 frames per second)
        dudraw.show(20)

        # Prepare for the next frame by moving circle, one pixel
        x += .0025
        y += .0025
        # Save keypress to check for 'q' next time through the loop
        key = dudraw.next_key()
        # if the mouse has been clicked, reset the x, y position to
        # the clicked location
        if dudraw.mouse_clicked():
            x = dudraw.mouse_x()
            y = dudraw.mouse_y()        


if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    main()
</code></pre>
<p>Here's a video demonstrating the above code running:</p>
<p><video src="https://cs.du.edu/~ftl/1352/videos/review/simplest_animation.mov" width="320" height="320" controls></video></p>
<p>To animate more complex objects, create a function that displays the object at the position given by parameters. (or, once you have learned to use classes, perhaps you will implement a method of a class to draw the object). Here's an example. Notice that very little of the <code>main()</code> function changed compared to the previous program, other than ignoring mouse clicks.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import dudraw
import random

# Simple drawing of a rocket with center at (x, y)
# The many details of this function are not the important part of this example.
def draw_rocket(x: float, y: float)-&gt;None:
    # rectangle, main body of rocket:
    dudraw.set_pen_color(dudraw.WHITE)
    dudraw.filled_rectangle(x, y, 0.03, .125)
    dudraw.set_pen_color(dudraw.BLACK)
    dudraw.rectangle(x, y, 0.03, 0.125)
    # cone at top of rocket (drawn as a rectangle)
    dudraw.set_pen_color(dudraw.WHITE)

        red = random.randint(50, 255)
        green = random.randint(0,red//2)

<p>A python list is a built-in data structure that holds an ordered collection of values. 
Python lists are mutable (the contents can be modified after creation), and can store any data type. If the individual elements of a list are each themselves a list, the result is a <em>nested list</em> (or <em>2D list</em>).</p>
<h2 id="creating-new-lists"><a class="header" href="#creating-new-lists">Creating new lists</a></h2>
<p>There are several ways to create new lists in python:</p>
<ul>
<li>List literals: write the comma-separated contents within square brackets, storing the list in a variable:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python"># contents of lists can be any type
greek_letters = ['alpha', 'beta', 'gamma', 'delta']
some_primes = [385351, 217739, 854123, 769733, 898091]
# lists can be nested
scores = [[94, 78, 56], [67, 82, 91]]
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Create an empty list, then append elements within a loop:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python">ten_odds = []
for i in range(10):
    ten_odds.append(2*i+1)
print(ten_odds)  # outputs [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19]

# get input from user, appending each entry into list:
friends = []
num_friends = int(input(&quot;How many friends? &quot;))
for i in range(num_friends):
    friend_name = input(&quot;Enter a name: &quot;)
    friends.append(friend_name)
print(friends)
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Use python's built-in <code>list()</code> function (called a 'constructor').
Pass any existing iterable (list, range object, tuple, string, dictionary) as the parameter,
and a new list will be created using its data.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python">greek_letters = ['alpha', 'beta', 'gamma', 'delta']
# create a new list, a copy of an existing list
copy_of_greek_letters = list(greek_letters)
# changing the copied list does not affect the original
copy_of_greek_letters.append('epsilon')
print(copy_of_greek_letters)  # alpha through epsilon
print(greek_letters) # still just alpha through delta

# create a list of the individual characters in a string
letters = list('haleakala') # letters is now ['h', 'a', 'l', 'e', 'a', 'k', 'a', 'l', 'a']
# create a list from the elements in a range object
values = list(range(1, 10)) # values is now [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# create a dictionary literal:
numbers = {1: 'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three'}
# create a list of the keys from an existing dictionary:
nums = list(numbers.keys())         # nums is [1, 2, 3]
# create a list of the values from an existing dictionary:
num_names = list(numbers.values())  # num_names is ['one', 'two', 'three']
# create a list of the (key, value) tuple pairs from an existing dictionary:
num_items = list(numbers.items())   #num_items is [(1, 'one'), (2, 'two'), (3, 'three')]
</code></pre>
<h2 id="accessing-elements-in-a-list"><a class="header" href="#accessing-elements-in-a-list">Accessing elements in a list</a></h2>
<p>You can access (view or change) each element in a list using its index value 
(the number of its location in the list) within square brackets. For example, <code>list_name[index]</code>.</p>
<p>Elements in a list are indexed starting at 0, so <code>list_name[0]</code> gives the value of the first element of the list,
and <code>list_name[n]</code> gives the value of the n+1st element in the list.</p>
<p>You can find out the number of elements in a python list with <code>len(list_name)</code>. 
So the value of the last element of a list is <code>list_name[len(list_name)-1]</code>. 
Alternately, in python, you can use an index of -1 for the last element of a list, so <code>list_name[-1]</code> is the value of the last element.
(Note that using an index value of -1 is not part of Java or C++, and will result in an index out of bounds error)</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">languages = [&quot;C++&quot;, &quot;python&quot;, &quot;Java&quot;, &quot;Perl&quot;, &quot;JavaScript&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;Go&quot;, &quot;Rust&quot;, &quot;Haskell&quot;, &quot;Perl&quot;]

# Access the first element in a list with an index value of 0
# Outputs &quot;I can program in C++&quot;&quot;
print(f&quot;I can program in {languages[0]}&quot;)

# Access the last element in a list with an index value of len(languages)-1 or -1:
# Both of the next lines output &quot;I can program in Perl&quot;
print(f&quot;I can program in {languages[len(languages)-1]}&quot;)
print(f&quot;I can program in {languages[-1]}&quot;)

# Lists are mutable, so you can modify the value of an element in the list using its index:
# This changes the first language in the list from &quot;C++&quot; to &quot;C#&quot;
languages[0] = &quot;C#&quot;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="removing-elements-from-a-list"><a class="header" href="#removing-elements-from-a-list">Removing elements from a list</a></h2>
<p>There are multiple ways to remove an element from a list in python. Here are two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the <code>remove()</code> list method. The parameter you pass is the <em>value</em> you want to remove. 
So the <code>remove()</code> method traverses through the list until it reaches the <em>first</em> instance of the value. That value is then removed from the list.
Details: this method does not return a value. If the value you want to remove is not found in the list, python throws a <code>ValueError</code>.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Remove the first instance of &quot;Perl&quot; from the list
languages.remove(&quot;Perl&quot;)
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Use the <code>pop()</code> list method. The parameter you pass is the <em>index</em> you want to remove.
Details: the <code>pop()</code> method returns the value of the element it removed. If the index you pass as a parameter is invalid, python throws an <code>IndexError</code>.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Remove the index 1 element (2nd element) from the list
removed = languages.pop(1)
print(removed)   # the output is &quot;python&quot;, and &quot;python&quot; is no longer in the list
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Similar to <code>pop()</code>, you can use the <code>del</code> keyword to remove an element at a specific index. Details: the value stored at that index is not returned. If the index is invalid, python throws an <code>IndexError</code>.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Remove the index 0 element (first element) from the list
del languages[0]
</code></pre>
<h2 id="traversing-lists"><a class="header" href="#traversing-lists">Traversing lists</a></h2>
<p>You can traverse lists three different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>you can use an index (index-based traversal), or </li>
<li>you can traverse directly through the values of the list (content-based traversal), or</li>
<li>you can traverse using <code>enumerate()</code>, which tracks both index and content.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="example-showing-three-techniques-for-traversing-a-list"><a class="header" href="#example-showing-three-techniques-for-traversing-a-list">Example showing three techniques for traversing a list:</a></h3>
<pre><code class="language-python"># index-based traversal through list:
# Here, i iterates over all indexes in the list (0 through len(languages)-1)
for i in range(len(languages)):
    print(f&quot;I can program in {languages[i]}&quot;)

# content-based traversal through list:
# Here, language iterates over all values stored in the list
for language in languages:
    print(f&quot;I can program in {language}&quot;)

# traversal through list using enumerate()
# (allows you to track index and value simultaneously)
# Here, one variable (i) holds the index and another (language) holds the value
for i, language in enumerate(languages):
    # Separate the phrases with commas
    if i != len(languages) - 1:
        print(f&quot;I love {language}&quot;, end = ', ')
    # when you get to the last language, end sentence with an exclamation point
    else:
        print(f&quot;I love {language}!&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Note that above in the use of <code>enumerate()</code>, we access the value with the variable <code>language</code>.
But instead, since the index is available, we could have used <code>languages[i]</code>.</p>
<h2 id="the-in-keyword"><a class="header" href="#the-in-keyword">The <code>in</code> keyword</a></h2>
<p>You can use the <code>in</code> keyword to determine if a value exists anywhere in the list. It returns a True/False result.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">if &quot;Java&quot; in languages:
    print(&quot;Java is in the list&quot;)
</code></pre>
<h2 id="list-methods"><a class="header" href="#list-methods">List methods</a></h2>
<p>There is a long list of methods you can use to help you manipulate lists. Please see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists">Official python documentation on lists</a> for detailed information.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="review-of-python-dictionaries"><a class="header" href="#review-of-python-dictionaries">Review of python dictionaries</a></h1>
<p>A python dictionary is a built-in data structure that holds (key, value) pairs. The key/value pairs are called <em>items</em>.
The purpose of a dictionary is to store these pairs in a way that makes it very efficient to look up the value given the key.
Python dictionaries are mutable (the contents may be modified after creation). 
The keys themselves must be of an immutable type, but the values may be any data type 
(including dictionaries and lists, making for a nested data structure).</p>
<h2 id="creating-new-dictionaries"><a class="header" href="#creating-new-dictionaries">Creating new dictionaries</a></h2>
<p>There are several ways to create new dictionaries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dictionary literals: Each key and value is separated with a colon, while the key:value pairs are separated by commas.
Then the comma-separated pairs are placed within a pair of curly braces:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python"># dictionary literal for looking up state capitals:
state_capitals = {
    &quot;Alabama&quot;: &quot;Montgomery&quot;,
    &quot;Alaska&quot;: &quot;Juneau&quot;,
    &quot;Arizona&quot;: &quot;Phoenix&quot;,
    &quot;Arkansas&quot;: &quot;Little Rock&quot;,
    &quot;California&quot;: &quot;Sacramento&quot;,
    &quot;Colorado&quot;: &quot;Denver&quot;,
    # etc...
}
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Create an empty dictionary, then enter elements into the dictionary within a loop (this strategy is especially useful
for building a dictionary from data stored in a file):</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python">student_ids = {}
name = &quot;&quot;
while name != &quot;.&quot;:
    name = input(&quot;Student name? (Enter . to finish) &quot;)
    if name != &quot;.&quot;:
        student_id = input(&quot;Student id? &quot;)
        # the following line makes name:id be a key:value pair in the dictionary
        student_ids[name] = student_id 
print(student_ids)
</code></pre>
<p>Note: keys in a dictionary are unique. So if you enter a duplicate key with a new value, the original key:value pair is replaced.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a dictionary using the <code>dict()</code> function. This constructor allows you to pass the information in a variety of forms.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Create a copy of an existing dictionary:
copy_state_capitals = dict(state_capitals)

# Create a dictionary from a list of tuples (each tuple is a key/value pair)
numbers_to_words = dict([(1, 'one'), (2, 'two'), (3, 'three')])

# Create a list of tuples by zipping together two separate lists,
# the first is the list of keys, the second is the matched list of values.
# Then create a dictionary from that zipped list of tuples
numbers_to_words = dict(zip([1, 2, 3], ['one', 'two', 'three']))
</code></pre>
<p>The number of items (i.e., the number of key/value pairs), is given by <code>len(dictionary_name)</code>.</p>

<p>Given a key, you can look up the associated value in a dictionary using square brackets. 
The keys act much like the index in a list, but they do not have to be integers!
Put the key within square brackets (<code>dictionary_name[key]</code>). This expression gives the value associated with that key.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Using the state_capitals dictionary defined above, this line outputs &quot;Juneau&quot;
print(state_capitals[&quot;Alaska&quot;])

# Using the numbers_to_words dictionary created above:
# find out the user's age, then output it in words
age = int(input(&quot;How old are you? &quot;))
print(f&quot;You are {numbers_to_words[age]} years old!&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Sample output:</p>
<pre><code>How old are you? 3
You are three years old!
</code></pre>
<p>Alternately, you can look up the value associated with a key using the <code>get()</code> method. Pass the key as a parameter.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">age = int(input(&quot;How old are you? &quot;))
print(f&quot;You are {numbers_to_words.get(age)} years old!&quot;)

<p>If you try to access a non-existent key in a dictionary with <code>dictionary_name[key]</code>, python crashes with a <code>KeyError</code>. 
You can address this issue in multiple ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the python dictionary <code>get()</code> method. If the key is not found, it will not crash - instead it returns <code>None</code></li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python">state = input(&quot;What state's capital do you want to know? &quot;)
print(f&quot;The capital of {state} is {state_capitals.get(state)}.&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Sample output:</p>
<pre><code>What state's capital do you want to know? Minneshota
The capital of Minneshota is None.
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Use the <code>in</code> keyword to confirm the key is in the dictionary before accessing it:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python">state = input(&quot;What state's capital do you want to know? &quot;)
if state in state_capitals:
    print(f&quot;The capital of {state} is {state_capitals[state]}.&quot;)

</code></pre>
<p>Sample output:</p>
<pre><code>What state's capital do you want to know? Minneshota

<p>By putting <code>dictionary_name[key]</code> on the left side of an assignment statement, 
you can change the value associated with that key (if the key is already in the dictionary), 
or create a new item with the given key/value (if the key is not already in the dictionary).</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># The key 3 is already in the dictionary, so the next line changes its value

</code></pre>
<p>Alternately, you can use the <code>update()</code> method, particularly if multiple new key/value pairs are to be added at once:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># adds two new key value pairs (5, 'five') and (6, 'six') to the numbers_to_words dictionary

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="list-comprehension"><a class="header" href="#list-comprehension">List Comprehension</a></h1>
<p>List comprehension is a convenient strategy built into python for creating lists by manipulating existing 
lists, range objects, or other iterable objects. (Note that list comprehension is not part of Java or C++,
but you will see it again in other functional programming languages.)</p>
<p>The idea of list comprehension is to include the definition of a loop within the one line that creates the list.</p>
<h3 id="example-1"><a class="header" href="#example-1">Example 1</a></h3>
<p>Here is some code that creates a list of the first ten positive odd integers:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">ten_odds = []
for i in range(10):
    ten_odds.append(2*i+1)
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the expression <code>2*i+1</code> gives the values to append to the list,
while the code <code>for i in range(10)</code> gives the values to use for the variable <code>i</code>. In list comprehension, 
both of these are embedded into the one-line definition of the list. The line below creates
the identical list:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">ten_odds = [2*i+1 for i in range(10)]
</code></pre>
<h2 id="generate-new-lists-using-any-iterable-object"><a class="header" href="#generate-new-lists-using-any-iterable-object">Generate new lists using any iterable object</a></h2>
<p>The examples below demonstrate that you can use list comprehension to create new lists, by traversing any iterable object.</p>
<h3 id="example-2"><a class="header" href="#example-2">Example 2</a></h3>
<p>Consider this list:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">digits = ['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9']
</code></pre>
<p>That same list can be defined more robustly using list comprehension:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">digits = [str(i) for i in range(10)]
</code></pre>
<p>With practice, you'll use list-comprehension creatively in a wide variety of applications.</p>
<h3 id="example-3"><a class="header" href="#example-3">Example 3</a></h3>
<p>You can create lists using list comprehension by looping over <em>any</em> iterable object. Here we iterate over an existing list:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23]
primes_squared = [prime*prime for prime in primes]
</code></pre>
<p>For reference, here is the code that accomplishes the same task using a for-loop:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23]
primes_squared = []
for prime in primes:
    primes_squared.append(prime*prime)
</code></pre>
<h3 id="example-4"><a class="header" href="#example-4">Example 4</a></h3>
<p>You can break a string into a list of its individual characters:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">letters = [character for character in 'Hello, World']
# letters = ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', ',', ' ', 'W', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd']
</code></pre>
<h3 id="example-5"><a class="header" href="#example-5">Example 5</a></h3>
<p>You can create a list from an existing dictionary's keys, or values:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">us_state_to_abbrev = {
    &quot;Alabama&quot;: &quot;AL&quot;,
    &quot;Alaska&quot;: &quot;AK&quot;,
    &quot;Arizona&quot;: &quot;AZ&quot;,
    # etc...
}
# state_names is a list of all of the state names (a list of the keys extracted from us_state_to_abbrev dictionary)
state_names = [state_name for state_name in us_state_to_abbrev.keys()]
# abbreviations is a list of all of the state abbreviations (a list of the values extracted from us_state_to_abbrev dictionary)
abbreviations = [abbrev for abbrev in us_state_to_abbrev.values()]
</code></pre>
<h2 id="list-comprehension-and-conditionals"><a class="header" href="#list-comprehension-and-conditionals">List Comprehension and conditionals</a></h2>
<p>We've seen list comprehension of the form</p>
<p><strong>new_list = [<em>value</em> for <em>variable</em> in <em>iterable</em>]</strong></p>
<p>Now we'll add a conditional (an if-clause) to restrict some of the values from being included in the list:</p>
<p><strong>new_list = [<em>value</em> for <em>variable</em> in <em>iterable</em> if <em>conditional_expression</em>]</strong></p>
<h3 id="example-6"><a class="header" href="#example-6">Example 6</a></h3>

<pre><code class="language-python">ten_odds = [i for i in range(20) if i%2==1]
</code></pre>
<h3 id="example-7"><a class="header" href="#example-7">Example 7</a></h3>
<p>Extract all of the upper-case letters from an existing string:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">letters = [character for character in 'Hello, World' if character.isupper()]
# letters = ['H', 'W']
</code></pre>
<h3 id="example-8"><a class="header" href="#example-8">Example 8</a></h3>

letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']
new_list1 = [digit + letter for digit in digits for letter in letters]
# new_list1 = ['1a', '1b', '1c', '2a', '2b', '2c', '3a', '3b', '3c']
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the nested loop above does <em>not</em> create a nested list - it is still a 1D list, constructed with a nested loop.</p>
<p>As always with nested loops, it matters which loop is on the outside. 
In the above example, the first for statement (<code>for digit in digits</code>) is the outside loop,
while the second for statement (<code>for letter in letters</code>) is the inside loop.
This means that we start with the first element in the outside loop (<code>digit = '1'</code>), and entirely complete
the inside loop (<code>for letter in letters</code>) before proceeding to the next element in the outside loop (<code>digit = '2'</code>).
After completing the inside loop (<code>for letter in letters</code>) entirely with <code>digit = '2'</code>, we then move to the next element
of the outer loop (<code>digit = '3'</code>).
This explains the order that the elements are appended to the list (all of the 1s, then all of the 2s then all of the 3s): <code>new_list1 = ['1a', '1b', '1c', '2a', '2b', '2c', '3a', '3b', '3c']</code>.</p>
<p>Notice what happens when we switch the order of the two for-loops. </p>
<pre><code class="language-python">digits = ['1', '2', '3']
letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']
new_list2 = [digit + letter for letter in letters for digit in digits]
# new_list2 = ['1a', '2a', '3a', '1b', '2b', '3b', '1c', '2c', '3c']
</code></pre>
<p>The outer for-loop is now <code>for letter in letters</code> and the
inner for-loop is now <code>for digit in digits</code>. This means that elements using <code>letter = 'a'</code> are all appended before moving on to
all elements using <code>letter = 'b'</code>, and finally all elements using <code>letter = c</code>. 
The list therefore starts with all the 'a's, then all the 'b's, then all the 'c's: <code>new_list2 = ['1a', '2a', '3a', '1b', '2b', '3b', '1c', '2c', '3c']</code></p>
<h2 id="creating-nested-lists-with-a-2d-list-comprehension"><a class="header" href="#creating-nested-lists-with-a-2d-list-comprehension">Creating nested lists with a 2D list comprehension</a></h2>
<p>You can also use list comprehension to create nested lists. At first the syntax seems similar to list comprehension with nested loops,
but notice the all-important extra set of list brackets (<code>[]</code>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">digits = ['1', '2', '3']
letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']
nested_list = [[digit + letter for letter in letters] for digit in digits]
# nested_list = [['1a', '1b', '1c'], ['2a', '2b', '2c'], ['3a', '3b', '3c']]
</code></pre>
<p>Here we have a list comprehension with the loop <code>for digit in digits</code>. For each of those digits, an entire list is created,
resulting in a list of lists. Each internal list is itself created with a list comprehension (<code>[digit + letter for letter in letters]</code>)
So we have a nested list-comprehension (not a list comprehension with nested loops). This makes the result a nested list. 
(<code>nested_list = [['1a', '1b', '1c'], ['2a', '2b', '2c'], ['3a', '3b', '3c']]</code>).</p>

<p>Think of a list as a linear storage of multiple values.</p>

<p>In python you can also have two-dimensional (2D) lists. A 2D list is a matrix or grid of values.</p>

<h2 id="why-do-we-need-2d-lists"><a class="header" href="#why-do-we-need-2d-lists">Why do we need 2D lists?</a></h2>
<p>There are many uses for 2D lists in programming. For example, many games require storage of information in two dimensions.
Writing a computer program in python to implement any of the following games would likely use a 2D list:</p>
<figure>
<img src="chapters/lists_and_dicts/games_2D.png" alt="Images of 2-dimensional games" class="center", width="500">
</figure>
<p>Another example is the storage of digital images, which can be stored as 2D lists. If you zoom in closely on a digital image, you will see that the image is composed of small squares of color called pixels (the word comes from “<em>pic</em>ture <em>el</em>ements”).
So the image can be stored as a 2D grid of colors. In python this is a 2D list, or a list of lists.</p>
<figure>
<img src="chapters/lists_and_dicts/pixels.png" alt="Visual demonstrating how images are composed of pixels" class="center", width="500">
</figure>
<p>Third, sometimes information is best organized in a grid. In these cases, the data would be stored in a 2D list. For example, here's a table that stores the temperature recorded by several different sensors at several times of day:</p>
<figure>
<img src="chapters/lists_and_dicts/temperatures.png" alt="Table of temperatures for several sensors at several times" class="center", width="500">

<p>And here's a table showing the average heating bill for several different apartments during each quarter of the year:</p>
<figure>
<img src="chapters/lists_and_dicts/heating_bill.png" alt="Table of heating bills" class="center", width="500">
</figure>
<p>Next we will look at how 2D lists are stored in python as lists of lists.</p>
<h2 id="defining-2d-lists-in-python"><a class="header" href="#defining-2d-lists-in-python">Defining 2D lists in python</a></h2>
<p>One way to create a 2D list in python is to use a 2D <em>list literal</em>. You've already learned how to create a 1D list literal, and the syntax here is similar. However, instead of a simple list, here we have a list of lists, or nested list.</p>
<p>The python code below creates a list of lists that stores the contents of the heating bill table shown above:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">heating_bill = [
    [112, 32, 10, 96],
    [60, 15, 0, 70],
    [196, 65, 15, 180]
]
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that <code>heating_bill</code> is a list with 3 items. Each item is itself a list. </p>
<ul>
<li>The first element <code>heating_bill[0]</code> is itself a list: <code>[112, 32, 10, 96]</code>.</li>
<li>The second element <code>heating_bill[1]</code> is itself a list: <code>[60, 15, 0, 70]</code>.</li>
<li>The third element <code>heating_bill[2]</code> is itself a list: <code>[196, 65, 15, 180]</code>.</li>
</ul>

<figure>
<img src="chapters/lists_and_dicts/2D_indices.png" alt="Accessing 2D lists using indices" class="center", width="500">
</figure>
<p>Rather than focusing on a 2D list as a list of lists, another perspective is to think of it as a rectangular grid, each position having a row position and a column position. So to indicate a specific element, you give two index values. The first index gives the row and the second index gives the column.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>heating_bill[0][0]</code> refers to row index <code>0</code>, column index <code>0</code>, whose value is <code>112</code>.</li>
<li><code>heating_bill[2][3]</code> refers to row index <code>2</code>, column index <code>3</code>, whose value is <code>180</code>.</li>
<li><code>heating_bill[1][2]</code> refers to row index <code>1</code>, column index <code>2</code>, whose value is <code>0</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that it would not have worked to create one dictionary with just the city names and corresponding populations. Keys must be unique - but there are two cities with the same name! So adding the second &quot;Springfield&quot; to the dictionary would have overwritten the first &quot;Springfield&quot;. Cities within states though, are required to have distinct names (you can't have two towns named Springfield within the same state), so we didn't run into this issue with our original structure. This is why the question asked you to produce a new key, that included the name of the city together with the state abbreviation.</p>
<p>One subtle point in the above code is the creation of that new key. The expression <code>city + &quot;, &quot; + state</code> is a string concatenation, building the name in the form &quot;city, state&quot;.</p>

<p>Notice that each iteration through the outer loop processes one row of the main list (in other words, <code>row</code> is one of the inner lists).
So here the variable <code>row</code> is itself a list! That's why in the inner loop we can execute another for loop, traversing through
the list <code>row</code>. In the inner loop, for each iteration through the loop, city is an entry in the list for that state. 
Giving clear names to the variables is part of documenting your code well.</p>

            print(f'I love {more_cities[row_index][col_index]}!')
        else:
            print(f'I love {more_cities[row_index][col_index]},', end = ' ')
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>I love Denver, I love Colorado Springs, I love Pueblo!
I love Los Angeles, I love San Diego, I love Fresno!
I love Chicago, I love Springfield, I love Champaign!
I love Boston, I love Worcester, I love Springfield!
</code></pre>
<p>This time the outer loop traverses over each index of rows, meaning <code>row_index</code> varies through 0, 1, 2, 3. When <code>row_index == 0</code>, we will look at the cities in Colorado, when <code>row_index == 1</code>, we will look at the cities in California, when <code>row_index == 2</code>, we will look at the cities in Illinois, and when <code>row_index == 3</code>, we will look at the cities in Massachusetts. For each value of <code>row_index</code>, our inner loop has <code>col_index</code> taking the values 0, 1 and 2 (one value of <code>col_index</code> for each city in that state).
Then inside the two loops, <code>more_cities[row_index][col_index]</code> accesses the city name for the relevant row index and column index.</p>
<p>Important note on number of rows and number of columns: <code>len(more_cities)</code> gives the number rows. Since <code>more_cities</code> is a list of lists, its length is the number of lists (which is the number of rows, or 4). Notice that <code>more_cities[row_index]</code> is itself a list (because it is one of the rows). So <code>len(more_cities[row_index])</code> gives the number of columns in that row, or 3.</p>
<p>By knowing the index values (rather than just the content stored at each location), we can determine when we are on the last one
(either the last row or the last column). This gives us a way to put all of the cities for each state on one line.</p>

<p>Some programmers prefer this method most, since it allows us to know the index value ('row_index' and 'col_index'), but also to have easier access to the value stored there (just <code>city</code> instead of <code>more_cities[row_index][col_index]</code>).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="computation-traversing-nested-lists"><a class="header" href="#computation-traversing-nested-lists">Computation traversing nested lists</a></h1>
<p>If we have a 2D list of numbers, we might be interested in doing computations on the numbers in the list.</p>
<ul>
<li>We can compute the sum, maximum, or average of all elements in the 2D list.</li>
<li>We can compute the sum, maximum, or average of a specific row.</li>
<li>We can compute the sum,  max/min, or average of a specific column.</li>
<li>We can compute the sum, max/min, or average of each row.</li>
<li>We can compute the sum,  max/min, or average of each column</li>
</ul>
<p>The code needed to compute each of these differs in subtle, but very important ways.
We'll demonstrate this with an example.</p>
<p>Suppose we have a table of quiz scores for students in a course.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Student</th><th>Quiz 1</th><th>Quiz 2</th><th>Quiz 3</th><th>Quiz 4</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Student 1</td><td>78</td><td>83</td><td>62</td><td>91</td></tr>
<tr><td>Student 2</td><td>93</td><td>69</td><td>88</td><td>72</td></tr>
<tr><td>Student 3</td><td>75</td><td>82</td><td>78</td><td>83</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>The scores are stored in this 2D list:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">scores = [
    [78, 83, 62, 91],
    [93, 69, 88, 72],
    [75, 82, 78, 83],
]
</code></pre>
<h3 id="compute-a-quantity-for-the-entire-2d-list"><a class="header" href="#compute-a-quantity-for-the-entire-2d-list">Compute a quantity for the entire 2D list</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes we want to compute a quantity using all 12 elements in the 3x4 matrix. This requires us to traverse through every element
in the 2D list. We've seen previously multiple ways to do this (index-based traversal, content-based traversal, or using <code>enumerate()</code>).
We review the process with the code below, which finds the maximum value of all 12 scores in the 2D list, using index-based loops.
Notice that in this code block, the outer loop iterates over each row index, while the inner loop iterates over each column index.
This means that we visit each list element in row-major order. In other words, we first traverse every element in the first row, then every element
in the second row, then every element in the third row.
Detail: <code>len(scores)</code> gives the number of rows, while <code>len(scores[row_index])</code> gives the number of columns in a specific row.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Maximum value of all scores in the 2D list.
# In the outer loop, have the row index vary through index values 0, 1, 2, 
# and in the inner loop, have the column index vary through index values 0, 1, 2, 3.
# Before beginning, initialize the maximum to be the first score in the first list.
maximum = scores[0][0]
for row_index in range(len(scores)):
    for column_index in range(len(scores[row_index])):
        if scores[row_index][column_index] &gt; maximum:
            maximum = scores[row_index][column_index]
print(maximum) # outputs 93
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the given 2D list is rectangular, not jagged. In other words, each row has the same number of columns.
In this situation, we can actually reverse the order of the loops. Thus, this time the outer loop can vary over each of the column
index values 0, 1, 2, 3, while the inner loop varies over each row index 0, 1, 2. Reversing the order of the loops results in us visiting the
list elements in column-major order. So we first traverse every element in the first column, then every element in the second column,
then every element in the third column, and finally every element in the fourth column. Since we are finding a result that treats every
element in the matrix equally, it's fine to switch the order. Detail: <code>len(scores)</code> gives the number of rows. But one quirk of the
column-major ordering is that the number of elements in each column must be the same. 
For the number of columns, we will just use the number of columns in the first row, <code>len(scores[0])</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Maximum value of all scores in the 2D list, computed in column-major order.
# In the outer loop, have the column index vary through index values 0, 1, 2, 3
# and in the inner loop, have the row index vary through index values 0, 1, 2.
# Before beginning, initialize the maximum to be the first score in the first list.
maximum = scores[0][0]
for column_index in range(len(scores[0])):
    for row_index in range(len(scores)):
        if scores[row_index][column_index] &gt; maximum:
            maximum = scores[row_index][column_index]
print(maximum) # outputs 93
</code></pre>
<h3 id="compute-a-quantity-for-a-single-row"><a class="header" href="#compute-a-quantity-for-a-single-row">Compute a quantity for a single row</a></h3>
<p>If we want to calculate a quantity just for a single row, we do not need a nested loop.
Since the row index never changes, we allow the column index to traverse all possible columns with a single for loop.
This means that the <code>column_index</code> will vary from 0 to <code>len(scores[row_index])-1</code> 
(the number of columns is <code>len(scores[row_index])</code>).
The code below calculates the average of Student 3's scores.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Average score for student 3. The row_index of 2 doesn't change.
# The column_index varies from 0 to 3. Add up all four scores, then
# divide by the number of columns (the number of scores).
total = 0
for column_index in range(len(scores[2])):
    total += scores[2][column_index]
average = total/len(scores[2])
print(average) # outputs 79.5
</code></pre>
<h3 id="compute-a-quantity-for-a-single-column"><a class="header" href="#compute-a-quantity-for-a-single-column">Compute a quantity for a single column</a></h3>
<p>If we now want to calculate a quantity for only one specific column, there is similarly no need for a nested loop.
Instead, the column index never changes, but the row index traverses over all possible rows.
This means that the <code>row_index</code> will vary from 0 to <code>len(scores)-1</code> (the number of rows is <code>len(scores))</code>.
The code below calculates the average of all students on Quiz 4.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Average score of all students on Quiz 4. The column_index of 3 doesn't change.
# The row_index varies from 0 to 2. Add up all 3 scores, then divide
# by the number of rows (the number of students)
total = 0
for row_index in range(len(scores)):
    total += scores[row_index][3]
average = total/len(scores)
print(average) # outputs 82.0
</code></pre>
<h3 id="compute-a-quantity-for-every-row-individually"><a class="header" href="#compute-a-quantity-for-every-row-individually">Compute a quantity for every row individually</a></h3>
<p>Say we want to calculate a quantity for every row separately. Since we're finding the quantity for each row, and
the quantity requires us to look at every column, we'll need to examine every value in the matrix.
This means we must use nested for-loops. 
Since we are calculating a quantity row-wise, the outside loop <em>must</em> vary throughout the rows.
Allow the row_index to vary throughout each row, then in the inner loop compute the quantity for that single row (see two sections above).
The code below finds the average score for each student separately.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Average score for every student. The row_index changes in the outer
# loop. For each row_index, the column_index varies from 0 to 3, through
# each quiz score for that student. Add up all four scores, then
# divide by the number of columns.
for row_index in range(len(scores)):
    total = 0
    for column_index in range(len(scores[row_index])):
        total += scores[row_index][column_index]
    average = total/len(scores[row_index])
    print(average) # This line is executed 3 times, outputting 78.5, then 80.5, then 79.5
</code></pre>
<p>Since the quantity is being calculated separately for each row, 
notice that the initialization of variables must happen <em>inside</em> the outer loop, but <em>outside</em> the inner loop.
So the initialization <code>total=0</code> is indented, executing as the first line inside the outer loop. That total is reset to 0 for each
student. Notice also that we want to print the result separately for each student. Thus the print statement is indented one level.
The output is executed once for each student, at the end of the computation for that student.</p>
<h3 id="compute-a-quantity-for-every-column-individually"><a class="header" href="#compute-a-quantity-for-every-column-individually">Compute a quantity for every column individually</a></h3>
<p>Say we want to calculate a quantity for every column separately. This computation requires us to visit every value in the matrix,
so we must use a nested for-loop. But since we are doing a column-wise computation, the outer loop must vary over each column.
A matrix must be rectangular (not jagged) for this to work. In the outside loop, allow the <code>column_index</code> to vary over every column. 
Then within that loop, compute the quantity you want by looking at the values for each row within that column. This means the inner
loop will vary over every possible row.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Minimum score for each quiz. The column_index changes in the outer
# loop. For each column_index, the row_index varies from 0 to 2, through
# each quiz score for that student. Each time we find a score smaller
# than we've seen yet for that quiz, update the minimum
for column_index in range(len(scores[0])):
    # initialize minimum to the first row in this column
    minimum = scores[0][column_index]
    for row_index in range(len(scores)):
        if scores[row_index][column_index] &lt; minimum:   
            minimum = scores[row_index][column_index]  
    print(minimum) # This line executes 4 times, outputting 75, then 69, then 62, then 72
</code></pre>
<p>Because we are doing a separate computation for each column, notice that the initialization of <code>minimum</code> happens just inside the outer
for-loop. We initialize <code>minimum</code> to the first student's score on that quiz. Then at the end of the inner loop, the output of the result
is indented one level, so it is output once for each column.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="functions"><a class="header" href="#functions">Functions</a></h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will review functions in python. We will include a review of ideas learned in a previous quarter, and some new ideas as well. Several of the sections are duplicates from the textbook from the previous quarter <a href="https://cs.du.edu/~intropython/intro-to-programming">COMP 1351 Intro to Programming textbook</a></p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="user-defined-functions-in-python"><a class="header" href="#user-defined-functions-in-python">User-defined functions in python</a></h1>
<p>Most programming languages give you a way to separate a block of code from the main program. This is useful to</p>
<ul>
<li>provide organization to your program by chunking it into blocks that perform specific tasks, and</li>
<li>allow you to reuse a block of code rather than repeat it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="creating-user-defined-functions"><a class="header" href="#creating-user-defined-functions">Creating user-defined functions</a></h2>
<p>This is the syntax for creating a user-defined function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def function_name() -&gt; None:
    # Code block for the function
</code></pre>
<p>Key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The keyword <code>def</code> signals the beginning of a function definition.</li>
<li>The empty pair of parentheses <code>()</code> indicates that this function does not take any arguments (input values to the function). Function arguments are explained in a later section.</li>
<li>The <code>-&gt; None</code> indicates that the function does not return any values. Function return values are explained in a later section.</li>
<li>Defining functions is not completely new to you - you have defined the function <code>main()</code> in every program you have written.</li>
<li>When you define a function, note that the code in the function is <strong>not executed</strong>. The code within the function is executed only when you <em>call</em> the function.</li>
<li>Think of the function definition as a recipe, telling python exactly what to do when another part of the program calls the function.</li>
<li><em>Calling</em> a function means to use it, or to <em>run its code</em>. We also say <em>execute</em> the function or <em>invoke the function</em>.  To call a function, at the point where you want it to run, write the name of the function, with parentheses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Here is the definition of a function called <code>greet_user()</code>. It asks the user their name, then says hello, using their name:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def greet_user() -&gt; None:
    name = input(&quot;What is your name? &quot;)
    print(&quot;Hello,&quot;, name)
</code></pre>
<p>In the above code, nothing is executed. The lines of code within the function only get executed when the function is called. Consider the following program that defines and uses (calls) the function <code>greet_user()</code>:</p>
<figure>
<img src="chapters/functions/greet_user.png" alt="definition and use of greet_user() function" class="center", width="300">
</figure>
<p>In the above code, lines 1-3 are the <em>definition</em> of the <code>greet_user()</code> function. Those lines define what you want python to do whenever <code>greet_user()</code> is called. Similarly, lines 5-6 are the <em>definition</em> of the <code>main()</code> function. The first executable lines are lines 9-10. On line 10, the function <code>main()</code> is executed, which in turn, on line 6, calls the <code>greet_user()</code> function. So when python executes line 6, it puts <code>main()</code> on hold, jumps to line 1, and executes the contents of the <code>greet_user()</code> function. That's the moment that the user is asked for their name, and the greeting is output. After that completes, the running of the program reverts back to line 6 in <code>main()</code> and continues from there.</p>
<h2 id="commenting-functions"><a class="header" href="#commenting-functions">Commenting functions</a></h2>
<p>In this course, we will have a standard for commenting every function. After the <code>def</code> line, put a block comment explaining the purpose of the function. This special block comment is called a <em>docstring</em>. When we learn about parameters and return values, we will add additional information into these docstrings.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def greet_user() -&gt; None:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    First example of a user-defined function. Ask user for their name, then
    output &quot;Hello, &quot;, followed by their name
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    name = input(&quot;What is your name? &quot;)
    print(&quot;Hello,&quot;, name)
</code></pre>
<h2 id="putting-it-all-together"><a class="header" href="#putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together</a></h2>
<p>The following code shows a program that defines and uses several functions. Each of these functions defines how to draw a part of the final image. The definition of each function has been collapsed - you can't see the contents. This is actually helpful, because while looking at the program from the highest level, the details are distracting. Notice that in <code>main()</code> we can easily see the overall task of the program from the four function calls. If the details of drawing each shape were placed into one long <code>main()</code> function, the higher-level organization of the program would be lost, mired in the details. This demonstrates the importance of using functions to break down code into bite-sized chunks.</p>

<h2 id="summary"><a class="header" href="#summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p>A function definition is a collection of code statements grouped together that perform a specific task.</p>
<p>Every function has a name that can be used to <em>call</em> the function. We also use the terms <em>invoke</em>, or <em>execute</em> to mean <em>run the lines of code that appear within the function definition</em>.</p>
<p>You can think of the function definition as a recipe for how to perform a task. When the function is invoked, then the task is actually performed.</p>
<h3 id="why-use-functions"><a class="header" href="#why-use-functions">Why use functions?</a></h3>
<p>There are three main reasons that functions are useful in programming:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reusability</p>
<p>Often we need to use the same code multiple times.
One solution is to copy/paste the code to reuse it. A downside of that strategy is that it makes our programs much longer. But an even worse downside is that if we make a modification, we need to find and make that same change in every place we copied the code to. Functions instead allow us to efficiently invoke the same code whenever needed without making multiple copies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abstraction</p>
<p>Once a function has been written and tested, we don't need to know how it works anymore. We only need to remember its <strong>name, purpose, parameters, and return value</strong>. For example, when you use the <code>dudraw.circle()</code> function, you can just use it without bothering your mind with the distraction of how that function creates the circle. This allows us to build functions from functions already written, and thus produce very complicated software much more easily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Code organization and readability</p>
<p>Organizing  your code into a sequence of function calls allows you to focus while you are programming on just the task at hand. It also makes it far easier for others to read your code and understand it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="next-up-arguments-and-return-values"><a class="header" href="#next-up-arguments-and-return-values">Next up: arguments and return values</a></h3>
<p>The next two sections cover the following topics:</p>
<p>Functions may take input values (called arguments or parameters) that modify or control how the function runs. This allows the line of code that invokes the function to pass needed information to the function.</p>
<p>Functions may also have output values (called return values). Usually this is the result of some work that the function has completed. It is a way for the function to pass back needed information to the function that called it. </p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="functions-that-take-arguments"><a class="header" href="#functions-that-take-arguments">Functions that take arguments</a></h2>
<p>You're already familiar with calls to functions that take input values (<em>arguments</em>, or <em>parameters</em>). For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># The `print()` function accepts an argument - the string to output to the console
print(&quot;Hello!&quot;)

# The dudraw ellipse function takes four arguments
# x-location of center, y-location of center, half-width, and half-height
dudraw.ellipse(0, 0, 1, 0.5)
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that when you call (i.e., <em>use</em>) a function that has parameters, you put those values within the parentheses of the function call. These actual values are called <em>arguments</em>. You must pass the correct number of arguments (i.e., the number of values that the defined function is expecting), and they must be passed in the correct order.</p>
<p>We will now learn how to create user-defined functions that accept arguments. When defining the function, we give a name to refer to each value that will be passed by the caller. These named values are called <em>parameters</em>, and within the function definition you can treat them just like variables. The parameter name can be used only within the function definition. Here is the template:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def function_name(parameter1_name: parameter1_type, parameter2_name: parameter2_type,...) -&gt; None:
    # Code defining the function
</code></pre>
<p>Example 1: In the program below, the simple function <code>greet_user()</code> outputs <code>&quot;Hello, world!&quot;</code> to the console multiple times. The argument to the function determines how many times the greeting is output to the terminal. The argument gives a way of passing information (the number of greetings to output) from the line that calls the function to within the function itself.</p>
<table>
<tr><td>Code</td><td>Output</td></tr>
<tr>
<td nowrap>
<pre><code class="language-python">def greet_user(num_greetings: int) -&gt; None:
    for i in range(num_greetings):
        print(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;)

def main():
    greet_user(5)

    main()
</code></pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre><code>Hello, world!
Hello, world!
Hello, world!
Hello, world!
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Example 2: Here we see the definition of a simple function that takes two parameters: the number of greetings to output, and the name of the user.</p>
<table>
<tr><td>Code</td><td>Output</td></tr>
<tr>
<td nowrap>
<pre><code class="language-python">def greet_user(num_greetings: int, name: str) -&gt; None:

def main():
    name = input(&quot;What is your name? &quot;)
    num = int(input(&quot;How many greetings do you want? &quot;))
    greet_user(num, name)

</td>
<td>
<pre><code>What is your name? Mahsa
How many greetings do you want? 3
Hello, Mahsa!
Hello, Mahsa!
Hello, Mahsa!
</code></pre>
</tr>
</table>
<p>In this course, we will have a standard for commenting functions. After the <code>def</code> line, put a block comment (a docstring) explaining the purpose of the function as well as any parameters and what their purpose is. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def greet_user(num_greetings: int, name: str) -&gt; None:
    &quot;&quot;&quot; Give greetings to the user, including their name
        parameters:
            num_greetings: number of repetitions of greeting (type: int)
            name: username, to be included in greeting (type: str)
        return: None
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    for i in range(num_greetings):
        print(f&quot;Hello, {name}!&quot;)
</code></pre>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="functions-that-return-a-value"><a class="header" href="#functions-that-return-a-value">Functions that return a value</a></h1>
<p>Once a function completes its task, sometimes it is useful for the function to <em>return</em> a result to the line of code that called it. You can choose the type of the returned value. If no value is returned, then the return type is <code>None</code>.</p>
<p>For example, the <code>print()</code> function, as in</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(&quot;Hello!&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>takes an argument (the input to the function is <code>&quot;Hello&quot;</code>), but it does not return a value.</p>
<p>But the <code>input()</code> function does return a value: it returns what the user typed. The return type is <code>str</code>.  When the function is <em>invoked</em>, it returns a value after it is done executing. You may do whatever is useful with that return value. In the example below the value returned by the <code>input()</code> function is stored in the variable <code>name</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">name = input(&quot;Enter your name: &quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>In the above line, the right-hand-side of the assignment statement is an expression whose value is whatever the <code>input()</code> function returned. So the return value of <code>input()</code> is stored in the variable <code>name</code>.</p>
<p>Another example is the <code>random()</code> function, which returns a <code>float</code>. We may choose to store the value that is returned in a variable. Or we may choose to pass that return value as an argument to another function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Store the return value in a variable:
x_position = random()
# Pass the return value to the print function:
print(random())
</code></pre>
<h2 id="user-defined-functions-that-return-values"><a class="header" href="#user-defined-functions-that-return-values">User-defined functions that return values</a></h2>
<p>When you define a function, you only need to do so once. Once defined, however, a function may be invoked (used) many times. You can think of a function as a black box that performs work with optional inputs and an optional output. When invoking the function, you don't need to be concerned any longer about its inner workings.</p>
<p>The syntax is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def function_name(optional parameters) -&gt; return type:
    # Indented code block
    # Optional return statement
    # (You may leave out the return statement if the function returns `None`)
</code></pre>
<p>Example:
Here's a function that takes a <code>float</code> parameter named <code>temp_f</code> that represents a temperature in Fahrenheit (think of <code>temp_f</code> as an input value to the function). The function then computes the conversion of the temperature to Celsius. The converted value <code>temp_c</code> of type <code>float</code> is returned (think of <code>temp_c</code> as an output value from the function).</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def celsius(temp_f: float) -&gt; float:
    # compute the conversion from fahrenheit to celsius
    temp_c = (temp_f - 32) * 5 / 9
    return temp_c
</code></pre>
<p>In the example above, think of the parameter <code>temp_f</code> as a local variable of the <code>celsius()</code> function. That variable can only be accessed <em>within</em> the scope of the function. When the function completes execution, the variable <code>temp_f</code> is destroyed and can no longer be accessed. On the last line of the function, the <code>return</code> statement has the effect of sending the value <code>temp_c</code> back to the line that invoked the function. Here is a sample of how the <code>celsius()</code> function might be invoked:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">    user_temp_f = float(input(&quot;Please enter the temperature in Fahrenheit: &quot;))
    user_temp_c = celsius(user_temp_f)
    print(f&quot;{user_temp_f} degrees Fahrenheit is {user_temp_c:.1f} degrees Celsius&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>The first line gets a <code>float</code> Fahrenheit temperature from the user.
The second line calls (invokes) the <code>celsius()</code> function. The value of the variable <code>user_temp_f</code> is passed as the parameter to the <code>celsius()</code> function. Within the <code>celsius()</code> function, that value is stored in the <code>temp_f</code> variable and the result is computed. Then the <code>celsius()</code> function returns the <code>float</code> value result. Back in the main code block, the right-hand-side of the assignment statement evaluates to the return value from <code>celsius()</code>. So that value is stored in the <code>user_temp_c</code> variable.
The last line gives full formatted output to the user.</p>
<p>Note that <code>celsius(user_temp_f)</code> is actually an expression, with a value (the return value) and a type (<code>float</code>). This means we can put <code>celsius(user_temp_f)</code> in our code <em>anywhere</em> that we can validly put any expression. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">    print(celsius(user_temp_f))
</code></pre>
<p>In the above line of code, <code>celsius(user_temp_f)</code> is an expression whose value is whatever the <code>celsius</code> function returns. That value is passed in turn as a parameter to the <code>print()</code> function! This might remind you of function composition in algebra, where the output from one function is fed in as the input to another function. A more sophisticated example of this is shown below, a compression of the previous example from  three lines of code into two:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">user_temp_f = float(input(&quot;Please enter the temperature in Fahrenheit: &quot;))
print(f&quot;{user_temp_f} degrees Fahrenheit is {celsius(user_temp_f):.1f} degrees Celsius&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Technical note: python is known as a <em>dynamically-typed language</em>. This means that the types of each variable are not determined until you run the program. Thus, unlike many other programming languages, mismatch of types (e.g., your function returns a value of the wrong type) is not detected until run-time. A consequence of this is that explicitly stating the return type in python is optional. In the context of this course, however, we will typically explicitly state the return type.</p>
<h2 id="boolean-functions"><a class="header" href="#boolean-functions">Boolean functions</a></h2>
<p>Note that a function may return a value of type <code>bool</code>. These are called <em>boolean functions</em>, and just as before, the return value can be used as an expression. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def first_digit_even(number: int) -&gt; bool:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Determine whether or not the first digit (leftmost digit) of a decimal number is even.
    parameters:
        number: a positive integer (type: int)
    return:
        True if number if first digit is even, False if first digit is odd
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    # Keep dividing by 10 until the number is less than 10
    while number &gt;= 10:
        number = number // 10

    # Now we have a one-digit number. See if that digit is even
    return number%2 == 0
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>while</code>-loop repeatedly divides by 10 using integer division (shifting the number to the right), until only one digit remains. That digit is the first digit (left-most digit) of the original number. Then on the last line, the expression <code>number%2==0</code> evaluates to <code>True</code>  if that first digit is even, and <code>False</code> if that first digit is odd. The <code>True</code> or <code>False</code> value gets returned.</p>
<p>Here's an example of a code snippet that uses the function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">user_num = int(input(&quot;Enter a positive integer: &quot;))
if first_digit_even(user_num):
    print(f&quot;The first digit of {user_num} is even.&quot;)
else:
    print(f&quot;The first digit of {user_num} is odd.&quot;)
</code></pre>
<h2 id="putting-it-all-together-1"><a class="header" href="#putting-it-all-together-1">Putting it all together</a></h2>
<p>The following example code defines and uses a boolean function <code>is_prime()</code> that determines whether or not an integer is prime.
A prime number is an integer bigger than 1 that is divisible only by 1 and by itself.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def is_prime(number: int) -&gt; bool:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    A function that determines whether or not a number is prime
    parameters:
        number: a positive integer greater than 1 (type: int)
    return:
        True if number is prime, False otherwise (type: bool)
    &quot;&quot;&quot;

    # tester is a possible factor. Start at 2 and we will increase it
    tester = 2

    while tester &lt; number:
        if number % tester == 0:
            # We now know that tester divides number, so
            # we know the answer - number is not prime!
            # The function terminates, returning False
            return False
        else:
            tester += 1

    # We only reach this line if no return False above ever occurred.
    # This means that the number has no factors and thus it is prime
    return True
    
def main():
    # The user inputs an integer and we determine if it is prime
    num = int(input(&quot;Enter an integer to test for primality: &quot;))
    if is_prime(num):
        print(f&quot;{num} is prime&quot;)
    else:
        print(f&quot;{num} is not prime&quot;)

# Run the program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</code></pre>
<p>Key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The input for this function is an integer bigger than 1 (our program would be improved if we checked for this condition).</li>
<li>The output is a boolean (<code>True</code> if <code>number</code> is prime, <code>False</code> otherwise).</li>
<li>It's helpful for boolean functions to have names that reflect that they return a <code>True/False</code> result. Here, <code>is_prime()</code> reads like a question that has a yes/no answer. When we call the function, the line
<code>if is_prime(23):</code> makes sense when we read it.</li>
<li>A function should only perform one task. Here, the job is to determine whether or not the number is prime. The function does <em>not</em> output the result to the console. The function just returns the <code>True</code>/<code>False</code> result to the line that invoked it. It's up to the caller to interact with the user. This philosophy makes for more flexible and reusable functions.</li>
<li>Within the loop of the <code>is_prime()</code> function, we can only return <code>False</code>, never <code>True</code>. Because only by completing the entire loop can we know that <code>number</code> has no factors (other than 1 and itself). The <code>return True</code> can thus only happen after the loop has completed.</li>
<li>The program could be made to run more efficiently by stopping the loop after <code>tester</code> reaches the square root of <code>number</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>By placing the code to determine whether a number is prime into a separate function, we can now re-use it in  multiple ways. For example, here is a new <code>main()</code> function that outputs all primes less than <code>1000</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def main():
    # Output all primes less than 1000, testing each number one by one
    for i in range(2, 1000):
        if is_prime(i):
            # output the number if it is prime:
            print(i, end = &quot; &quot;)
    # Move output to a new line
    print()
</code></pre>
<p>You should notice how simple it was to create this new program. The <code>is_prime()</code> function did not need to be rewritten or even thought about. This is the power of creating functions that perform well-defined tasks.</p>
<p>Here is yet another example. This time we will build another layer on top of the <code>is_prime()</code> function by creating a function called <code>next_prime()</code> to give the next prime larger than a specific integer. Notice that <code>next_prime()</code> itself uses <code>is_prime()</code>, so its job is made straightforward and easy to understand. By the use of these two functions, the interface with the user in <code>main()</code> is also very straightforward. This organization and structure makes code easier to read and understand, easier to fix if it has an error, and easier to enhance or modify if we choose to later. Notice that the contents of <code>is_prime()</code> are not shown here, since that function is identical to before.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def is_prime(number: int) -&gt; bool:
    # contents not shown - it's unchanged from before!

def next_prime(number: int) -&gt; int:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Return the first prime greater than or equal to number
    parameters:
        number: input value for which we need to return the next prime (type: int)
    return:
        a prime value greater than or equal to number (type: int)
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    # start from number, and increment until we find the next prime
    while not is_prime(number):
        number += 1
    # The loop has terminated, so the current value of number must be the next prime.
    return number
    

def main():
    n = int(input(&quot;Give me a number and I will tell you the next prime: &quot;))
    print(f&quot;The next prime is {next_prime(n)}&quot;)

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="default-argument-values"><a class="header" href="#default-argument-values">Default argument values</a></h1>
<p>Default argument values give a way to make it optional for the caller to pass an argument to a function.
In fact, you've already seen examples of optional arguments to functions.
Perhaps you have noticed that some functions can be called with different numbers of arguments. 
For example, you can call <code>dudraw.clear()</code> with either no arguments or one argument:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">dudraw.clear(dudraw.GREEN)  # clears the canvas, all pixels are now GREEN
dudraw.clear()              # this time no argument is passed - so the default is to clear with dudraw.WHITE
</code></pre>
<p>Here's another example. You may pass an argument to <code>print()</code> to specify what the end character is. But you may also leave that argument out, in which case <code>print()</code> ends with a newline.</p>
<p>Without the end character optional argument:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># The code below puts &quot;Hello&quot; and &quot;World&quot; on two different lines, 
# since the default end character for print() is a newline (&quot;\n&quot;):
print(&quot;Hello,&quot;)
print(&quot;World!&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>Hello,
World!
</code></pre>
<p>With the end character optional argument:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Alternately, we can pass an optional extra argument to print().
# The first print() statement below ends with a space rather than the default newline.
# So the two strings are output separated by a space, not a newline.
print(&quot;Hello,&quot;, end = &quot; &quot;)
print(&quot;World!&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>Hello, World!
</code></pre>
<h2 id="how-does-this-work"><a class="header" href="#how-does-this-work">How does this work?</a></h2>
<p>Behind the scenes, in the definition of <code>dudraw.clear()</code> a default value for the argument is specified (namely <code>dudraw.WHITE</code>). By doing so, it allows the client code (your code) to either include or omit that argument. If you include the argument, it specifies the background color. But if you omit that argument, then the function uses the default value <code>dudraw.WHITE</code> as the color. The default value is specified in the definition of the function.</p>
<p>Similarly, you may include or omit an additional argument to <code>print()</code> to specify the end character. (for example, <code>end = &quot; &quot;</code>). If you call <code>print()</code> without the <code>end</code> parameter, then <code>print()</code> automatically uses the default end value <code>&quot;\n&quot;</code>.</p>
<h2 id="defining-your-own-functions-with-default-argument-values"><a class="header" href="#defining-your-own-functions-with-default-argument-values">Defining your own functions with default argument values</a></h2>
<p>If you want to create functions that can be called with or without one or more of the arguments, specify <code>parameter_name = default_value</code> in the function header. If you specify a default value, then it becomes optional to pass that argument when the function is called.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># The greet() function outputs &quot;Hello, {name}!&quot;. The default value for name is &quot;World&quot;.
# So if no name is passed as a parameter, then the function outputs &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
def greet(name: str = &quot;World&quot;):
    print(&quot;Hello, &quot; + name + &quot;!&quot;)

def main():
    greet(&quot;Sami&quot;)    # outputs &quot;Hello, Sami!&quot;
    greet(&quot;Phyllis&quot;) # outputs &quot;Hello, Phyllis!&quot;
    greet()          # outputs &quot;Hello, World!&quot;

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    main()
</code></pre>
<p>If there are two or more parameters, then mandatory arguments must come first. So always put
parameters with default values at the end of the parameter list. Here's another example (taken from python documentation <a href = "https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#default-argument-values" target = "blank">https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#default-argument-values</a></p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># There are three parameters. The second two parameters have default values.
def ask_ok(prompt, retries=4, reminder='Please try again!'):
    while True:
        reply = input(prompt)
        if reply in {'y', 'ye', 'yes'}:
            return True
        if reply in {'n', 'no', 'nop', 'nope'}:
            return False
        retries = retries - 1
        if retries &lt; 0:
            raise ValueError('invalid user response')
        print(reminder)
</code></pre>
<p>The above function can be called multiple ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>giving only the mandatory argument: <code>ask_ok('Do you really want to quit?')</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>giving one of the optional arguments: <code>ask_ok('OK to overwrite the file?', 2)</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or even giving all arguments: <code>ask_ok('OK to overwrite the file?', 2, 'Come on, only yes or no!')</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="keyword-arguments"><a class="header" href="#keyword-arguments">Keyword arguments</a></h1>
<p>In the header of a function definition, you name the parameters. These names are local variable names, meaning that the variables are only accessible within the function definition itself. In the line that <em>invokes</em> (or <em>calls</em>) the function, values (called <em>arguments</em>) are passed to fill in as the values of the parameters. These arguments must be passed in the correct order. Consider this example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def attribute(author: str, title: str)-&gt;None:
    print(f&quot;{author} wrote the book {title}.&quot;)

def main():
    attribute(&quot;Richard Wright&quot;, &quot;Native Son&quot;)
    # Oops, here's a bug, the arguments are in the wrong order!
    attribute(&quot;Harry Potter&quot;, &quot;J.K. Rowling&quot;)

# Run the program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>Richard Wright wrote the book Native Son.
Harry Potter wrote the book J.K. Rowling.
</code></pre>
<p>In <code>main()</code>, the line </p>
<pre><code>attribute(&quot;Richard Wright&quot;, &quot;Native Son&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>invokes the <code>attribute()</code> function, with <code>&quot;Richard Wright&quot;</code> as the <code>author</code> and <code>&quot;Native Son&quot;</code> as the title. Notice, however, that the arguments are mistakenly in the wrong order on the next line:</p>
<pre><code>attribute(&quot;Harry Potter&quot;, &quot;J.K. Rowling&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p><code>&quot;Harry Potter&quot;</code> should have been the second argument (the title), and <code>&quot;J.K. Rowling&quot;</code> should have been the first argument (the author). Keyword arguments are intended to avoid bugs created by this type of mistake, and to simultaneously make code more readable.</p>
<p>To use a keyword argument, we give the name of the parameter along with the argument. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">attribute(author = &quot;Richard Wright&quot;, title = &quot;Native Son&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>The parameter names should exactly match the names given in the definition of the function itself. VSCode will tell you the name of the parameters so you don't have to refer back to the function definition to remember the names and order of the parameters. To access this feature, type Command-Shift-Space on a Mac, or Control-Shift-Space on Windows. This image shows what the parameter-hinting looks like in VSCode:</p>
<img src="chapters/functions/parameter_hinting.png"  width="50%" height="50%" alt = "When you invoke a function, VSCode tells you the parameter names">
<p>When you use keyword arguments, your code is often easier to understand, because the names of the variables makes the meaning of each argument clear.
If you use keyword arguments and you put the arguments in the wrong order, the values of the arguments are assigned by the variable names, not the order. However, we strongly advise that even when using keywords, you maintain the order of the variables in the function definition. Using the features of your IDE makes this easy.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Use keyword arguments to clarify and to reduce bugs:
attribute(author = &quot;Margaret Wise Brown&quot;, title = &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot;)
# Above we use keyword arguments with the arguments out of order
# Below is poor programming practice since the parameters are out of order. But notice that it still works:
attribute(title = &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, author = &quot;J.K. Rowling&quot;)

<p>Output:</p>

<p>If a function takes a parameter that represents the size of the problem (number of elements in a list, or number of repeats of a loop),
then we are very interested in how the execution time grows as the size of the problem grows. 
The pattern of this change is called the <em>order of growth</em> or <em>time complexity</em> of the algorithm.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If doubling the size of <code>n</code> results in a doubling of the execution time for the algorithm, then we call the algorithm <em>Big-O of n</em> or <em>linear</em>. We write this \(O(n)\).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If doubling the size of <code>n</code> results in a quadrupling of the execution time, then we call the algorithm <em>Big-O of n squared</em> or <em>quadratic</em>. We write this \(O(n^2)\).</p>

<p>We can see by a rough look at the data above that the algorithm shows linear, or \(O(n)\), behavior. Look at the time behavior when <code>n</code> is doubled or tripled:</p>
<p>When the size of <code>n</code> is doubled from 100 million to 200 million, the time approximately doubles (\(6.18 sec/3.13 sec \approx 2\)).</p>
<p>When the size of <code>n</code> is tripled from 100 million to 300 million, the time approximately triples (\(9.24/3.13 \approx 3\)).</p>
<p>When the size of <code>n</code> is doubled from 300 million to 600 million, the time approximately doubles (\(18.69/9.24 \approx 2\)).</p>
<p>When the size of <code>n</code> is tripled from 200 million to 600 million, the time approximately triples (\(18.69/6.18 \approx 3\)).</p>
<p>We can also see linear behavior by graphing the data, which appears to be a line:</p>

<p>This time, a rough look at the data above indicates that the algorithm shows quadratic, or \(O(n^2)\), behavior. Look at the time behavior when <code>n</code> is doubled or tripled:</p>
<p>When the size of <code>n</code> is doubled from 10000 to 20000, the time increases by approximately a factor of 4 \(12.37/3.09 \approx 4.003\)).</p>
<p>When the size of <code>n</code> is tripled from 10000 to 30000, the time increases by approximately a factor of 9 (\(28.08/3.09 \approx 9.09\)).</p>
<p>When the size of <code>n</code> is doubled from 30000 to 60000, the time increases by approximately a factor of 4 (\(116.78/28.08 \approx 4.16\)).</p>
<p>When the size of <code>n</code> is tripled from 20000 to 60000, the time increases by approximately a factor of 9 (\(116.78/12.37 \approx 9.44\))</p>
<p>Graphing the data hints at a parabolic (quadratic) shape. Caution though: while this graph convinces us that
the time complexity is not linear, graphs that are concave up might represent quadratic, cubic, exponential, or other growth rates.</p>

<p>If a function takes less than 1 second to execute, then the technique above is often not accurate.
Instead, we must execute the function multiple times (so the total elapsed time is more than 1 second), 
then divide by the number of times the function was called, to get the average execution time. You will learn this technique in a future course.</p>

<p>Consider a python program that has function calls. Here is a simplest example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def my_function(val: int):
    print(f&quot;In my_function() line 2, val is {val}&quot;)
    val = val + 10
    print(f&quot;In my_function() line 4, val is {val}&quot;)
    return val

def main():
    value = 23
    print(&quot;In main(), line 9&quot;)
    another = my_function(value)
    print(f&quot;In main(), line 11, value: {value}, another: {another}&quot;)


if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    main()
</code></pre>
<p>Below is an image of the same program, with line numbers that we will refer to while tracing the function.</p>
<img src="chapters/functions/simple_call_stack.png" alt="code with functions main() and my_function()" width="500"/>
<p>Please stop reading for a moment to trace the code by hand, giving the output. Run the code to double-check.</p>
<p>Notice that when the code runs line 10, it must evaluate the right-hand side by calling <code>my_function(value)</code> before it can
store the return value in the variable <code>another</code>. When the function <code>my_function(value)</code> is called, running of the function <code>main()</code> is paused until <code>my_function()</code> completes running and returns. At that point program control returns to line 10 and
picks back up where it left off.
When we trace code by hand, we naturally remember exactly where we paused, and even the values of the local variables. This allows us seamlessly resume running line 10 after <code>my_function()</code> completes executing and returns. However, unlike humans, computers have no natural or automatic process for remembering. Thus, when a function is called, all information about the current values of local variables and the line currently being executed must be stored. This information is all stored in the <em>call stack</em>.</p>
<p>The call stack consists of individual frames. When a function begins execution, a frame is added to the top of the call stack (we say it is &quot;pushed&quot; onto the stack). Each frame stores the current line number being executed, as well as the values of every local variable. When a new
function is invoked, a new frame is created and added to the top of the call stack.</p>
<p>Here is a memory diagram showing the state of the call stack when the program is executing line 7:</p>
<img src="chapters/functions/call_stack_line_7.png" alt="call stack memory diagram line 7" width="200"/>
<p>The next line creates a variable called <code>value</code>, and stores <code>23</code> there. On line 9, output is sent to the terminal. Here is the call stack memory diagram when the program is executing line 9. Notice that a new local variable to represent <code>value</code> has been added to the frame for the function <code>main()</code>:</p>
<img src="chapters/functions/call_stack_line_9.png" alt="call stack memory diagram line 9" width="200"/>
<p>On line 10, the program calls the function <code>my_function()</code>. This means that the funtion <code>main()</code> pauses its execution. A new frame for this call to <code>my_function()</code> is created and added to the top of the call stack. The top frame on the call stack always shows the information for the function that is currently executing. Here is the call stack memory diagram when the program has invoked <code>my_function()</code> and is executing line 2. Notice that <code>val</code> is passed as a parameter, so it behaves like a local variable. Its value is initialized with the value that was passed (23 in this case). The variable <code>val</code> exists only as long as <code>my_function()</code> is still executing. Thus we draw it in the frame associated with <code>my_function()</code>:</p>
<img src="chapters/functions/call_stack_line_2.png" alt="call stack memory diagram line 2" width="200"/>
<p>On line 3, the value stored in <code>val</code> is changed. Notice that only the local variable is modified. Since <code>my_function()</code> only has access to the local variables stored in its own frame, the variables owned by <code>main()</code> cannot be modified by this function. Here is the call stack memory diagram when the program is executing line 4:</p>
<img src="chapters/functions/call_stack_line_4.png" alt="call stack memory diagram line 4" width="200"/>
<p>On line 5 of the program, <code>my_function()</code> has completed execution and will return program control to the calling function (<code>main()</code> in this case). Python knows which frame to return to and which line to resume by looking at the <em>next frame down on the stack</em>. So the return value is passed back to the function call in the frame below, the frame for <code>my_function()</code> is destroyed (we call it getting &quot;popped&quot; from the stack), and <code>main()</code> resumes its process on the line stored in its frame.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="classes"><a class="header" href="#classes">Classes</a></h1>
<p>One of the key concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) is its use of classes. Implementing and using classes allows us to modularize our code, providing organization to large programs. Classes allow us to more easily write code that is reusable, debuggable, and extendible. Using classes, we can divide programs into separate parts that different people can work on simultaneously.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="classes-and-creating-objects"><a class="header" href="#classes-and-creating-objects">Classes and Creating Objects</a></h1>
<h2 id="motivation"><a class="header" href="#motivation">Motivation</a></h2>
<p>In python, a variable of type int, float, char, etc. can be used to store and reprsent one value.
But often one needs multiple values to represent one concept, or one object. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>a point in two-dimensional space is represented by two variables (x, y),</li>
<li>a rectangle has a center point, a width and a height,</li>
<li>a college registrar stores many pieces of information about each student (name, address, year in school, gpa, etc.),</li>
<li>a bouncing circle in an animation has an x-position, a y-position, a size, an x-velocity, a y-velocity, and a color.</li>
</ul>
<p>We see the advantage of bundling the multiple variables that represent an object in the above examples. The x and y values for a point should be stored together, as should the multiple pieces of information about a college student's record, or information for a bouncing circle in an animation.</p>
<p>All high-level programming languages give you a way to package multiple variables into one object. In object-oriented languages (including python), the idea goes further. You can uses classes to package <strong>data</strong> together with the <strong>code</strong> that manages and manipulates that data.</p>
<p>Example: Suppose we want to write python code to store data for a rectangle, together with code to manage and manipulate that data. We would do this by implementing a class called <code>Rectangle</code>, and would specify that the class store the variables <code>center_x</code>, <code>center_y</code>, <code>width</code>, and <code>height</code>. Variables that are part of a class are called <em>instance variables</em>. We would also specify it to have built-in functions to manage the rectangle, such as a function that would compute the area of the rectangle, or a function that would draw the rectangle. Functions that are part of a class are called <em>methods</em>.</p>
<p>The diagram below (a modified version of a UML diagram) shows the name of the class, the instance variables and their types, and the methods (with the parameter types and return value types):</p>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td><center>Rectangle</center></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Instance variables and their types:<br>
    <code>center_x: float</code><br>
    <code>center_y: float</code><br>
    <code>width: float</code><br>
    <code>height: float</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>methods (along with their parameters and return types):<br>
    <code>__init__(center_x: float, center_y: float, width: float, height: float)  # constructor (initialization method)</code><br>
    <code>draw(None)->None                   # display the rectangle</code>  <br>
    <code>area(None)->float                  # compute and return the rectangle area</code><br>
    </tr> 
</table>
<p>Once the <code>Rectangle</code> class has been implemented (either by ourselves or by someone else), just knowing the above interface allows us to use the class, even without knowing details about how it is implemented. This illustrates the concept of <em>abstraction</em>. The complexity of the implementation is hidden from the user of the Rectangle class.</p>
<h2 id="objects"><a class="header" href="#objects">Objects</a></h2>
<p>In the above example, once the <code>Rectangle</code> class has been implemented, other programmers can use that class, trusting that it was implemented correctly, without bothering themselves with how it was implemented. Any programmer wanting to store information about a rectangle and potentially compute its area or display it, would create one <code>Rectangle</code> object for each rectangle they want to represent. Each <code>Rectangle</code> object is treated like a single variable. That single variable is made up of multiple components, namely a <code>center_x</code>, <code>center_y</code>, <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>, as well as some methods (functions) for manipulating that rectangle.</p>
<p>Think of the Rectangle class as a &quot;cookie cutter&quot; that we can use to create multiple &quot;cookies&quot; (rectangles).</p>
<h2 id="how-to-create-objects---example"><a class="header" href="#how-to-create-objects---example">How to create objects - example</a></h2>
<p>To create a new rectangle object, we state the name of the class, and pass the required initialization parameters. This calls the constructor (or initialization method).</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">rectangle1 = Rectangle(2, 3, 0.1, 0.2)  # create a rectangle with center (2, 3), width 0.1, height 0.2
rectangle2 = Rectangle(4, 6, 0.15, 0.3) # create a rectangle with center (4, 6), width 0.15, height 0.3
</code></pre>
<p>The first line of code above creates (or <em>instantiates</em>) a new <code>Rectangle</code> object. This object has variable name <code>rectangle1</code>, and is a bundle of four instance variables (<code>center_x</code>, <code>center_y</code>, <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>). Note that the single line of code automatically creates 4 separate variables that are bundled together. The second line of code instantiates a second new <code>Rectangle</code> object. Again, a single line of code creates a bundle of 4 variables. The code that creates those 4 variables is in the <code>Rectangle</code> class's <code>__init__</code> function.</p>
<h2 id="using-or-invoking-methods"><a class="header" href="#using-or-invoking-methods">Using (or invoking) methods</a></h2>
<p>Once we have created an object, we can invoke the methods associated with it using the expression <code>object_name.method_name()</code>.
For example, the code below outputs the area of the object <code>rectangle1</code> that we instantiated above:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(rectangle1.area())
</code></pre>
<p>The next line of code displays to the <code>dudraw</code> canvas <code>rectangle2</code> that we instantiated above:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">rectangle2.draw()
</code></pre>
<h2 id="accessing-the-data-elements-in-an-object"><a class="header" href="#accessing-the-data-elements-in-an-object">Accessing the data elements in an object</a></h2>
<p>The data for an object is stored in its instance variables. You can access these values with the expression <code>object_name.instance_variable_name</code>. The following  lines of code output the values stored in the rectangles we created above:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(f&quot;Center point of rectangle1: ({rectangle1.center_x}, {rectangle1.center_y})&quot;)
print(f&quot;width and height of rectangle2: width = {rectangle2.width}, height = {rectangle2.height}&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Note about object-oriented programming: in good object-oriented programming practice, users of a class should never modify the contents of the instance variables directly - rather the contents should be modified in the code internal to the class. Often this is done through <em>setter</em> methods (also called <em>mutators</em>).
In fact, in true object-oriented languages (such as C++ or Java), code that uses a class may not even <em>see</em> the contents of the instance variables directly - they must access them using <em>getter</em> methods (also called <em>accessors</em>).</p>
<h2 id="more-about-abstraction"><a class="header" href="#more-about-abstraction">More about abstraction</a></h2>
<p>Notice that in the examples above, we wrote code that uses a class (the <code>Rectangle</code> class) just by knowing the interface of the class (described in the UML diagram shown above). We did so above without ever having seen the code that implements the class. Doing so relies on us confidently using the code written either by someone else or ourselves at a different time. By abstracting the data and functionality of the class, we're able to implement, debug, and test the two parts of the code (i.e., implement the class, and then use the class) completely separately. Breaking the code into separate units means we can implement very large programs by writing and testing just parts of it at a time.</p>
<h2 id="strings-are-objects"><a class="header" href="#strings-are-objects">Strings are objects</a></h2>
<p>We've actually used classes before this. When you create a string in python, it is an object of the <code>str</code> class. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">name = &quot;Bessie Mae &quot;
print(name.count('e'))           # outputs the number of e's in name
lower_case_name = name.lower()   # name.lower() returns a new string object, with all letters now lower-case
first_name = name.split()[0]     # extract the first word of the string
</code></pre>
<p>In the code above, we are invoking three different methods from the <code>str</code> class (<code>count()</code>, <code>lower()</code>, and <code>split()</code>). Notice that <code>name.count()</code>, <code>name.lower()</code>, and <code>name.split()</code> all fit the pattern <code>object_name.method_name()</code>.
You can find the official python documentation listing all available methods in the <code>str</code> class here: <a href = "https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods" target = "blank">https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods</a></p>

<p>Programming with classes and objects:</p>
<ul>

<li>makes it easier to create reusable code,</li>
<li>allows you to write, test, and debug segments of code separately,</li>
<li>results in code that is more maintainable,</li>

<p>For reference, in this section we will continue developing the <code>Rectangle</code> class created in the previous section:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># implementation of the Rectangle class:
class Rectangle:

    # Constructor (initializer)
    def __init__(self, center_x:float = 0, center_y:float = 0, width:float = 1, height:float = 1):
        self.center_x = center_x
        self.center_y = center_y
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

    # Display to dudraw canvas
    def draw(self)-&gt;None:
        dudraw.filled_rectangle(self.center_x, self.center_y, self.width/2, self.height/2)

    # Compute and return area
    def area(self)-&gt;float:
        return self.width*self.height
</code></pre>
<p>The following line of code instantiates (creates) an object of type <code>Rectangle</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">rectangle1 = Rectangle(2, 3, 0.1, 0.2) # create a rectangle with center (2, 3), width 0.1, height 0.2
</code></pre>
<p>Now suppose we want to output the contents of rectangle to the terminal. Naturally, we would try the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(rectangle1)
</code></pre>
<p>Disappointingly, the output to the terminal might look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;__main__.Rectangle object at 0x100afbfd0&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>When we output the contents of the rectangle object to the terminal, python by default outputs the location in memory where
the object is stored. It does so because we have not included in the definition of the <code>Rectangle</code> class what format the output 
of a <code>Rectangle</code> object should look like. To fix this issue, we must include a method called <code>__str__()</code> in the <code>Rectangle</code> class.
Its job is to build and return a string in the right format. If we have provided a <code>__str__()</code> method, then python will automatically
look for and call that method when we ask it to print an object.  Here is the <code>__str__()</code> method that we now include in the <code>Rectangle</code> class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">    # produce a string to represent this rectangle. Note that python will automatically 
    # call this method to produce a string whenever print(rectangle_object) is executed
    # Example of format for the string: center: (0.4, 1.2), width: 0.3, height: 0.5
    def __str__(self)-&gt;str:
        return f&quot;center: ({self.center_x}, {self.center_y}), width: {self.width}, height: {self.height}&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>After adding the <code>__str__()</code> method to the <code>Rectangle</code> class, when we execute the lines</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">rectangle1 = Rectangle(2, 3, 0.1, 0.2) # create a rectangle with center (2, 3), width 0.1, height 0.2
print(rectangle1)
</code></pre>
<p>the output is now:</p>
<pre><code>center: (2, 3), width: 0.1, height: 0.2
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>__str__()</code> method of a class is also called when you cast an object to a string. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">str(rectangle1)
</code></pre>
<p>is equivalent to</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">rectangle1.__str__()
</code></pre>

<p>If we have many objects, we can store them in a list. This use of classes highlights their power.</p>
<h2 id="example-1"><a class="header" href="#example-1">Example</a></h2>
<p>Let's use the class <code>Rectangle</code> that we implemented in the previous section. For reference, here is the code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># implementation of the Rectangle class:
class Rectangle:

    # Constructor (initializer)
    def __init__(self, center_x:float = 0, center_y:float = 0, width:float = 1, height:float = 1):
        self.center_x = center_x
        self.center_y = center_y
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

    # Display to dudraw canvas

<h2 id="instantiating-creating-a-list-of-objects"><a class="header" href="#instantiating-creating-a-list-of-objects">Instantiating (creating) a list of objects</a></h2>
<p>We will now create 100 <code>Rectangle</code> objects with random centers, each with width and height of 0.02, and store them in a list. 
Please note how short and simple this code is! First create an empty list to store the rectangles. 
Then, within a for loop, instantiate (create) a new <code>Rectangle</code> object, 
passing random values for the center, and 0.02 for the width and height. 
Finally, append that new rectangle to the list of rectangles.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># The following short segment of code creates 100 rectangle objects, with random centers
# and fixed width and height
rectangles = []
for i in range(100):
    new_rectangle = Rectangle(random.random(), random.random(), 0.02, 0.02)
    rectangles.append(new_rectangle)
</code></pre>
<p>Side note: the same list could be created in one line using list comprehension:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">rectangles = [Rectangle(random.random(), random.random(), 0.02, 0.02) for i in range(100)]
</code></pre>
<h2 id="traversing-iterating-over-the-list-of-objects"><a class="header" href="#traversing-iterating-over-the-list-of-objects">Traversing (iterating over) the list of objects</a></h2>
<p>Now that all 100 of our rectangles are stored in one list, we can iterate over that list, doing whatever we want with
each rectangle. For example, the following code displays all 100 rectangles to a dudraw canvas:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># This content-based loop iterates over each rectangle, displaying it 
# by calling its draw() method
for rectangle in rectangles:
    rectangle.draw()
dudraw.show(10000) # display for 10 seconds
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the above loop could alternately have been implemented with an index-based loop:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">for i in range(len(rectangles)):
    rectangles[i].draw()
dudraw.show(10000)
</code></pre>
<p>As another example, here's a loop that calculates the total area of all of the rectangles:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">total_area = 0
for rectangle in rectangles:
    total_area += rectangle.area()
print(total_area)
</code></pre>
<p>Exercise for you: convert the above code to an index-based loop.</p>
<p>As a third example of iterating over a list of objects, here is a loop that outputs to the terminal the data stored in the <code>rectangle</code> list. 
On the second line, python automatically calls the <code>__str__()</code> method we implemented in the <code>Rectangle</code> class.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">for i in range(len(rectangles)):
    print(rectangles[i])
</code></pre>
<p>Exercise for you: convert the above code to a content-based loop.</p>
<h2 id="a-quirk-of-python-when-printing-lists-of-objects"><a class="header" href="#a-quirk-of-python-when-printing-lists-of-objects">A quirk of python when printing lists of objects</a></h2>
<p>It would be very natural for you to think that the following line would output the contents of each rectangle in the list <code>rectangles</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(rectangles)
</code></pre>
<p>Since we have implemented <code>__str__()</code>, it seems like <code>__str__()</code> should be called for every element in the list we are outputting.
However, in python if we print our list of objects, the memory address of each object is output:</p>
<pre><code>[&lt;__main__.Rectangle object at 0x1024dcf10&gt;, &lt;__main__.Rectangle object at 0x10263df30&gt;, &lt;__main__.Rectangle object at 0x1032797e0&gt;,
&lt;__main__.Rectangle object at 0x104919900&gt;, &lt;__main__.Rectangle object at 0x104919960&gt;, &lt;__main__.Rectangle object at 0x1049199c0&gt;,
...
</code></pre>
<p>There is a way around this. When outputting a list of objects, python automatically calls the <code>__repr__()</code> method, not the <code>__str__()</code> method.
Let's implement the <code>__repr__()</code> method in our <code>Rectangle</code> class (having it just call our existing <code>__str__</code>() method).
Add this method to our <code>Rectangle</code> class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">    def __repr__(self)-&gt;str:
        return self.__str__()
</code></pre>
<p>Now when we execute the line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(rectangles)
</code></pre>
<p>we get our desired output:</p>
<pre><code>[center: (0.8229662378956932, 0.564174022001409), width: 0.02, height: 0.02, center: (0.16580614832245955, 0.17398244134557717), width: 0.02, height: 0.02,
center: (0.6660610136763881, 0.9802962789008293), width: 0.02, height: 0.02, center: (0.5937968938322629, 0.655517849943249), width: 0.02, height: 0.02,
...
</code></pre>
<p>It is good programming practice in python to implement a <code>__repr__()</code> method in every class.</p>
<p>Note: in python, there is another official purpose for <code>__repr__()</code> methods, 
so in future work you might be required to have <code>__repr__()</code> produce strings with a different format than <code>__str__()</code>.</p>

<h1 id="a-more-complicated-class"><a class="header" href="#a-more-complicated-class">A more complicated class</a></h1>
<p>We will use the <code>Point</code> class above to make a class called <code>Triangle</code>. 
Since a triangle has three vertices, our <code>Triangle</code> objects will have three instance variables 
(<code>self.vertex1</code>, <code>self.vertex2</code>, and <code>self.vertex3</code>), each of which is themself an object, of type <code>Point</code>.
This nesting of classes, in which one class has instance variables of another class is called <em>composition</em>. 
Composition is common practice in object-oriented programming. Trace carefully through the following code and
predict the output to the terminal.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Triangle:

    def __init__(self, v1: Point, v2: Point, v3: Point):
        self.vertex1 = v1
        self.vertex2 = v2
        self.vertex3 = v3

    def __str__(self)-&gt;str:
        return f&quot;Vertices: {self.vertex1} {self.vertex2} {self.vertex3}&quot;

    def shift(self, shift_by: Point)-&gt;None:
        self.vertex1.shift(shift_by)
        self.vertex2.shift(shift_by)
        self.vertex3.shift(shift_by)

# main code block:
p1 = Point(4, 1)
p2 = Point(7, 1)
p3 = Point(5, 2)
t1 = Triangle(p1, p2, p3)
print(t1)
t1.shift(Point(3, 4))
print(t1)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>Vertices: (4, 1) (7, 1) (5, 2)
Vertices: (7, 5) (10, 5) (8, 6)
</code></pre>
<p>The variable <code>t1</code> has three instance variables, each of which are points. 
For example, <code>t1.vertex1</code> represents the point (4, 1). Notice that since <code>t1.vertex1</code> is a <code>Point</code>, 
we can actually access its two instance variables, with <code>t1.vertex1.x</code> and <code>t1.vertex1.y</code>. 
However, in object-oriented programming practice, by convention we never modify an
instance variable's instance variable. Instead, we rely on that class to do the modification. 
You can see an example of this in the code above: the <code>shift()</code> method in the <code>Triangle</code> class does not itself change the values of each vertex. 
Instead, it calls the <code>Point</code> class's <code>shift()</code> method
to modify the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> values of each of the three vertices.</p>
<h2 id="a-class-with-a-list-as-an-instance-variable"><a class="header" href="#a-class-with-a-list-as-an-instance-variable">A class with a list as an instance variable</a></h2>
<p>Below we define and use the class <code>Polygon</code>. It has one instance variable, which is a list of its vertices
(each of which is a <code>Point</code> object). 
Notice that the methods in this class will often need to traverse through that list of vertices.
In the code below, you see these loops both in the <code>__str__()</code> method and the <code>shift()</code> method. Notice two different styles of iteration (looping through index or looping through content) are used, 
so you can see different options. Carefully trace the code and predict the output to the terminal.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Polygon:
    def __init__(self, vertices: list[Point]):
        self.vertices = vertices

<p>Recall that each object of a class has its own copy of each <em>instance variable</em>. On the other hand, there is a way to create variables that are shared by every object of the class - these are called <em>class variables</em>.</p>
<p>Key differences between instance variables and class variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each object has its own copy of every instance variable. But there is only one value stored for a class variable, shared by all objects.</li>
<li>Instance variables are most commonly created within the <code>__init__()</code> method of a class. On the other hand, class variables are created within the class, but <em>outside</em> of any method.</li>
<li>If an object makes changes to a class variable, that change is seen by every object (since the variable is shared). If an object makes changes to one of its instance variables, no other objects see a change to their own instance variables.</li>
<li>To access an instance variable, we say <code>object_name.instance_variable_name</code>. But to access a class variable, we say <code>ClassName.class_variable_name</code>.</li>

    # speed of light in miles per second
    # (this is a class variable)
    speed_of_light = 186000

    def __init__(self, name, mass, age, distance):
        self.name = name
        # store the mass, unit is number of times the mass of our sun
        self.mass = mass
        # store the age, unit is billions of years
        self.age = age
        # store the distance from earth, in light-years
        self.distance = distance

    def __str__(self)-&gt;str:
        return f&quot;{self.name}, mass: {self.mass} times Sol, age: {self.age}x10^9 years, distance: {self.distance} l.y.&quot;

        # miles = light years * seconds per year * speed of light in miles/second

sirius = Star(name = &quot;Sirius - the Dog Star&quot;, mass = 2.0, age = 0.2, distance = 8.6)

print(f&quot;distance of {sirius.name} from earth: {int(sirius.distance_in_miles())} miles&quot;)
# Demonstration that clients of the Star class can access class variables
print(f&quot;The speed of light is {Star.speed_of_light} miles per second.&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>output:</p>
<pre><code>Alpha Centauri A, mass: 1.1 times Sol, age: 5.3x10^9 years, distance: 4.37 l.y.
Sirius - the Dog Star, mass: 2.0 times Sol, age: 0.2x10^9 years, distance: 8.6 l.y.
distance of Alpha Centauri A from earth: 25633091520000 miles
distance of Sirius - the Dog Star from earth: 50444985600000 miles
The speed of light is 186000 miles per second.
</code></pre>
<p>What to notice in the above example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The variable <code>speed_of_light</code> is defined <em>within</em> the class <code>Star</code>, but outside of any method definition. This is how we know it is a class variable.</li>
<li>Since <code>speed_of_light</code> is a class variable, it is shared by all objects of the class. We use a class variable in this case to define a single constant that all objects of the class can access. (There are other uses of class variables - see below.)</li>
<li>Since class variables are conventionally accessed with <code>ClassName.class_variable_name</code>, in this example all objects can access the class variable with the expression <code>Star.speed_of_light</code>. </li>
<li>Look closely at the <code>distance_in_miles()</code> method of the <code>Star</code> class. This is where you see the use of the class variable <code>Star.speed_of_light</code>.</li>
<li>Notice that client code (the main code block) can also access class variables with <code>ClassName.class_variable_name</code>, as seen in the last line of the code, where <code>Star.speed_of_light</code> is output. Although viewing the values stored in a class variable from outside the class is legitimate, it is bad programming practice to modify class variables from outside the class, even though python allows it. Other object-oriented programming languages (C++, Java) have mechanisms for disallowing it.</li>
<li>Technical note: in python it is also possible to access class variables using the object name (i.e., <code>object_name.class_variable_name</code> rather than <code>ClassName.class_variable_name</code>. For example, in the above code, you can use the expression <code>self.speed_of_light</code> within the class definition, or <code>alphaA.speed_of_light</code> within the client code. However, this practice is strongly discouraged, since if you attempt to mutate (modify) the class variable with this notation, a new instance variable is created with that same name rather than modifying the class variable. This causes unexpected side-effects. Thus, it is widely accepted as good python programming practice to always use the notation <code>ClassName.class_variable_name</code>.</li>

<p>Because class variables are shared, we can use them to track events that occur class-wide. For example, we can use a class variable to count how many objects of a class have been instantiated. For example:</p>

<p>In the above code, the class variable <code>Widget.count</code> keeps track of the number of times a <code>Widget</code> object was instantiated. Since instantiation always calls the <code>__init__()</code> method, within that method we increment the class variable <code>Widget.count</code> to track the total number of <code>Widget</code> objects.</p>

<p>This time we will create another class variable to keep track of the total number of times any method within our class was invoked (called).

<p>Often it is important to give people or objects unique identification numbers. Examples of this in real life are Social Security numbers (no two individuals can share the same number) or student id numbers (every student at DU has a different 87-number). In python, one way to give every object of a class a unique id is to maintain a class variable that keeps track of the next available id to assign to each subsequent object. When an object is instantiated, in the <code>__init__()</code> method an instance variable is created to store that object's id, and it is to the next available id (stored in the class variable). Next, still within the <code>__init__()</code> method, the value of that class variable is incremented so that when the subsequent object is instantitated, its id will not collide with this or any previous object. In the example below, a class is used to represent financial transations. Each financial transaction is given its own unique transaction identification number.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class FinancialTransaction:

    # The class variable FinancialTransaction.next_unique_id keeps
    # track of next available id, which will be assigned to each new
    # FinancialTransaction object. The first id assigned is 20000
    next_unique_id = 20000

    def __init__(self, source: int, destination: int, amount: float):
        # routing number and account number of source of funds
        self.source = source
        # routing number and account number for deposit
        self.destination = destination
        # dollar amount of the transaction
        self.amount = amount
        # set the id number of this transaction to the next available number
        self.id = FinancialTransaction.next_unique_id
        # Update the next available id (since we just used up the current one)
        FinancialTransaction.next_unique_id += 1
    
    def __str__(self)-&gt;str:
        return f&quot;id: {self.id}, source: {self.source}, destination: {self.destination}, amount: {self.amount}&quot;

# main code block:
# create two transaction objects
transaction1 = FinancialTransaction(2345678900123, 1234567800987, 1223.47)
transaction2 = FinancialTransaction(1234567800987, 9876543200987, 2319.24)
print(transaction1)
print(transaction2)
</code></pre>
<p>output:</p>
<pre><code>id: 20000, source: 2345678900123, destination: 1234567800987, amount: 1223.47
id: 20001, source: 1234567800987, destination: 9876543200987, amount: 2319.24
</code></pre>
<p>Notice above that each id assigned is unique to that particular <code>FinancialTransaction</code> object. This technique guarantees no collisions of transaction id numbers.</p>

<p>In this chapter we look at more details of implementing classes. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>class customization using &quot;dunder&quot; (double-underscore) methods,</li>

<p>In python, methods that start with two underscores are called <em>dunder</em> (double-underscore) methods. They are sometimes also referred to as <em>special methods</em> or <em>magic methods</em>. These methods have special significance, since they are automatically invoked by python in certain situtations. You've seen two examples of this already: the <code>__init__()</code> function is automatically (or &quot;magically&quot;) invoked when you instantiate an object, and the <code>__str__()</code> method is automatically invoked when you print an object, and the <code>__repr__()</code> method is automatically invoked for each object when you print a list of objects. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Time24:
    &quot;&quot;&quot; A class that represents a time of day on a 24-hour clock
        Default time is 0 hours 0 minutes &quot;&quot;&quot;
    def __init__(self,h: int = 0, m: float = 0):
        # set up the instance variables. Note that this initialization
        # method does not do error checking on the values, and it should
        self.hours = h
        self.minutes = m

    # return a string formated as hour:minute. Since we're using
    # a 24-hour clock, it's 2 digits for both hours and minutes
    def __str__(self)-&gt;str:
        return f&quot;{self.hours:02d}:{self.minutes:02d}&quot;

    def __repr__(self)-&gt;str:
        return self.__str__()

time1 = Time24(12, 7)   # automatically calls __init__() to initialize to 12:07
time2 = Time24(2, 43)   # automatically calls __init__() to initialize to 02:43
time3 = Time24(12, 7)   # automatically calls __init__() to initialize to 12:07
default_time = Time24() # also calls __init__(), default time is 00:00
times = [time1, time2, time3, default_time]
print(time1)            # automatically calls __str__(), outputs 12:07
print(times)            # automatically calls __repr__() for each object
</code></pre>
<p>Carefully read and trace the code above, paying special attention to how <code>__init__()</code> automatically gets called when we instantiate an object, how <code>__str__()</code> automatically gets called when we print an object, and how <code>__repr__()</code> automatically gets called when we print a list of objects.</p>
<p>Besides <code>__init__()</code> and <code>__str__()</code>, and <code>__repr__()</code> methods, python has a long list of other dunder methods. First, we will learn the <em>rich comparison operators</em>, which allows us, whenever it makes sense, to compare two objects of a class using  the operators <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>==</code>, <code>!=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, and <code>&gt;</code>.</p>
<h2 id="using-the--operator-to-compare-two-objects"><a class="header" href="#using-the--operator-to-compare-two-objects">Using the == operator to compare two objects</a></h2>
<p>Notice that two of the <code>Time24</code> objects above (<code>time1</code> and <code>time2</code>) represent the same time of day. What do you think is output by the following line of code?</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(time1 == time3)
</code></pre>
<p>Are you disappointed to find out that the above line of code outputs <code>False</code>? By default, two objects evaluate as <code>==</code> in python when they represent the identical object (in other words, they are stored in the same memory location, and refer to the same object). Said differently, when evaluating <code>==</code> for two objects, by default python does not compare the <em>contents</em> of the objects to see if the <em>contents are the same</em>. But when dealing with objects, comparing the contents is often exactly what we want <code>==</code> to do. So python gives us a way to make the <code>==</code> comparison between objects compare the contents of the objects, according to a method we provide. This is called &quot;overloading the <code>==</code> operator&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-overload-the--operator"><a class="header" href="#how-to-overload-the--operator">How to overload the <code>==</code> operator</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Within the class, implement a method called <code>__eq__()</code>. </li>
<li>The <code>__eq__()</code> method defines in python code how to tell if two objects are <code>==</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>__eq__()</code> method is automatically (&quot;magically&quot;) called when you use <code>==</code> to compare two objects.</li>
<li>The <code>__eq__()</code> method should return a <code>bool</code>.</li>
<li>In our example, we will say two <code>Time24</code> objects equal if and only if they have the same values for hour and the same values for minutes. </li>
<li>The <code>__eq__()</code> method should take two parameters. The object on the
left side of <code>==</code> becomes <code>self</code>, and the object on the right side of the <code>==</code> becomes the second parameter, typically named <code>other</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Include this code in the <code>Time24</code> class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">    def __eq__(self, other: Time24)-&gt;bool:
        # Evaluate two Time24 objects as &quot;==&quot; if both of their instance variables (hours and minutes) are equal
        return self.hours == other.hours and self.minutes == other.minutes
</code></pre>
<p>Now the following line outputs <code>True</code>, as desired:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(time1 == time3)  # automatically calls the __eq__ method from the Time24 class, time1 is self, time3 is other
</code></pre>
<p>Whenever you overload the <code>==</code> operator by implementing <code>__eq__()</code> in your class, you should also overload the <code>!=</code> operator by implementing <code>__ne__()</code> in your class. Rather than modifying the code in <code>__eq__()</code>, in <code>__ne__()</code> you can just return the logical negation of the result of <code>__eq__()</code>. Include this method in the <code>Time24</code> class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">    def __ne__(self, other: Time24)-&gt;bool:
        return not self==other  # notice that this calls __eq__() automatically
</code></pre>
<h2 id="using-the--operator-to-compare-two-objects-1"><a class="header" href="#using-the--operator-to-compare-two-objects-1">Using the &lt; operator to compare two objects</a></h2>
<p>We would like the following line to output <code>False</code>, since time2 is 2:43 in the morning, and time2 is in the afternoon:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(time1 &lt; time2)
</code></pre>
<p>But here's the output:</p>
<pre><code>TypeError: '&lt;' not supported between instances of 'Time24' and 'Time24'
</code></pre>
<p>When objects in a class have a natural linear ordering, then it makes sense to compare them with the <code>&lt;</code> operator. To implement this in python, we provide a <code>__lt__()</code> method in our class. The <code>__lt__()</code> method should return a boolean, and take two parameters. The <code>__lt__()</code> method will automatically be called when the code <code>object &lt; object2</code> is evaluated, with <code>object1</code> becoming the parameter <code>self</code>, and <code>object2</code> becoming the parameter <code>other</code>. For example, here is an implementation of <code>__lt__()</code> for our <code>Time24</code> class. Insert this code into the class.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">    def __lt__(self, other: Time24)-&gt;bool:
        if self.hours &lt; other.hours:
            return True
        elif self.hours &gt; other.hours:
            return False
        else:
            return self.minutes &lt; other.minutes
</code></pre>
<p>Here is some demo code to show how the <code>__lt__()</code> method gets called:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(time1 &lt; time2)        # calls __lt__(), outputs False (time2 is earlier in the day)
print(time1 &lt; time3)        # outputs True (they are equal, so time1 isn't less than time3)
print(default_time &lt; time2) # outputs True, midnight is earlier than every other time

</code></pre>
<h2 id="the-other-rich-comparison-operators"><a class="header" href="#the-other-rich-comparison-operators">The other rich-comparison operators</a></h2>
<p>The table below lists the names of the dunder methods to implement for each of the comparison operators.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Operator</th><th>dunder method</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><code>==</code> (equal to)</td><td><code>__eq__(self, other)</code></td></tr>

</div>
<p>Notice that each operator is actually the negation of one of the other operators. For example, <code>&gt;=</code> is the negation of <code>&lt;</code>. You can use this to shorten your code.

<p>Suppose we have a class that it makes sense to do arithmetic with. For example, say I implement the <code>Point</code> class, where each point is a location in the (x, y) plane. In some contexts it is mathematically useful to add two points by separately adding their x and y coordinates. For example, (1, 3) + (6, 5) = (7, 8). Consider the following implementation of the <code>Point</code> class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Point:

    def __init__(self, x: float, y: float):
        # initialize the values of the point (x, y)
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __str__(self)-&gt;str:
        # format the string in (x, y) form
        return f&quot;({self.x}, {self.y})&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>We wish the following code would output (7, 8):</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">point1 = Point(1, 3)
point2 = Point(6, 5)
point3 = point1 + point2
print(point3)
</code></pre>
<p>But instead here's the output:</p>
<pre><code>TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'Point' and 'Point'
</code></pre>
<p>We can &quot;teach&quot; python how to add objects of our <code>Point</code> class by implementing the method <code>__add__()</code> in our class. The <code>__add__()</code> method will automatically be called when python evaluates the expression <code>point1 + point2</code>. It takes two parameters, <code>self</code> and <code>other</code>, where the first summand <code>point1</code> takes the role of <code>self</code>, and the second summand <code>point2</code> takes the role of <code>other</code>. The <code>__add__()</code> method should create and return a new <code>Point</code>, whose values are the sums of the individual points. Here's the implementation, which is incorporated into the <code>Point</code> class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">    def __add__(self, other: Point)-&gt;Point:
        newx = self.x + other.x
        newy = self.y + other.y
        new_point = Point(newx, newy)
        return new_point
</code></pre>
<p>Now, the code</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">point1 = Point(1, 3)
point2 = Point(6, 5)
point3 = point1 + point2
print(point3)
</code></pre>
<p>outputs</p>
<pre><code>(7, 8)
</code></pre>
<p>Note: the <code>__add__()</code> function could be condensed to one line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">    def __add__(self, other: Point)-&gt;Point:
        return Point(self.x+other.x, self.y+other.y)
</code></pre>
<p>All of the arithmetic operators you are used to can be overloaded. The table below shows a partial list of arithmetic operators and the dunder methods they correspond to:</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="variables-are-references-to-objects"><a class="header" href="#variables-are-references-to-objects">Variables are references to objects</a></h1>
<p>A variable that refers to an object is technically a reference. This means that the variable stores the memory address of the object itself (in other words, the location in your computer's memory where the full data for the object is stored). To see this in action, consider this implementation of the class <code>Point</code>, which has no <code>__str__()</code> method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Point:

    def __init__(self, x, y):
        # initialize the values of the point (x, y)
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
    
# main code block:
point1 = Point(3, 5)
point2 = Point(3, 5)
print(point1)
print(point2)
</code></pre>
<p>output:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;__main__.Point object at 0x100b1bfd0&gt;
&lt;__main__.Point object at 0x100b1be50&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Without the <code>___str__()</code> method to override the form of the output, python returns the contents of the variable, which is its memory address (shown in the above output as a hexadecimal number).</p>
<p>This means that the number stored in each variable is a memory address. Examining the values stored <em>at that memory address</em>, we find the actual data associated with the object.  So the variable is a <em>reference</em> of where to find the actual contents of the object. We can represent this situation visually with this memory diagram:</p>
<img src="chapters/classes2/memory_diagram_1.png" alt="Memory diagram of references to Point objects" width = 350>
<p>It is awkward to write the values of the memory addresses themselves, in particular because without running the program, we do not even know what these memory addresses will be. Therefore, by convention we represent memory diagrams like the literal one above more abstractly by using arrows. The start of the arrow is <em>inside</em> the reference variable, and the arrow points to the part of the diagram where the data itself is held. Because the arrow starts within the reference variable's box, it represents that the information stored in the variable is a memory address. The endpoint of the arrow represents where that memory address points to.</p>
<img src="chapters/classes2/memory_diagram_2.png" alt="Abstract diagram of references to Point objects" width = 350>
<p>We view the literal and abstract memory diagrams as equivalent, and we prefer the abstract version because it is easier to visually process. The arrows make it clear that each variable is a reference to an object.</p>
<h2 id="the-python-id-function"><a class="header" href="#the-python-id-function">The python <code>id()</code> function</a></h2>
<p>Suppose we now implement the <code>__str__()</code> method in the <code>Point</code> class, as shown below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Point:

    def __init__(self, x, y):
        # initialize the values of the point (x, y)
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
    
    def __str__(self)-&gt;str:
        return f&quot;({self.x}, {self.y})&quot;

# main code block:
point1 = Point(3, 5)
point2 = Point(3, 5)
print(point1)
print(point2)
</code></pre>
<p>output:</p>
<pre><code>(3, 5)
(3, 5)
</code></pre>
<p>Now that the <code>__str__()</code> has been implemented, when we output the object to the terminal, we no longer see the memory address. However, we can still find out the memory address where the object is stored by using the python <code>id()</code> function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(id(point1))
print(id(point2))
</code></pre>
<p>output:</p>
<pre><code>4306616272
4306615888
</code></pre>
<p>These are the memory addresses of where the objects are stored, in decimal.</p>
<p>Note that the two ids that are output above are not the same. Even though <code>point1</code> and <code>point2</code> have the same values, they are distinct objects, stored in separate memory locations. Note that if we were to change the x or y values of one of the points, the other would not change, since they are separate objects.</p>
<h2 id="copying-references"><a class="header" href="#copying-references">Copying references</a></h2>
<p>Suppose we modify the main code block to the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># main code block:
point1 = Point(3, 5)
point2 = Point(3, 5)
point3 = point2
</code></pre>
<p>The last line in the above code is an assignment statement, that stores in <code>point3</code> the value found in <code>point2</code>. Since that value is a reference (a memory address), the result is to copy the memory address to <code>point3</code>. Here is a literal memory diagram showing the result of the assignment statement. Note that <code>point2</code> and <code>point3</code> store the same memory address, so they have the same id.</p>
<img src="chapters/classes2/memory_diagram_3.png" alt="Memory diagram including two references to the same object" width = 350>
<p>The abstract version of this diagram (using arrows instead of actual memory addresses) is below. The arrows make it more obvious that two variables (<code>point2</code> and <code>point3</code>) are referring to the same object. There are only two different <code>Point</code> objects, since only two <code>Point</code> objects were instantiated.</p>
<img src="chapters/classes2/memory_diagram_4.png" alt="Abstract memory diagram of two references to the same object" width = 350>
<p>Suppose now we modify the contents of <code>point2</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">point2.x = 7
print(point1)
print(point2)
print(point3)

<p>Since <code>point2</code> and <code>point3</code> refer to the same object, changing one of them also changes the other, as seen in the memory diagram below. Note that <code>point1</code> refers to an entirely different object, so it is not changed.</p>

<h2 id="identity"><a class="header" href="#identity">Identity</a></h2>
<p>In a previous section (<a href="chapters/classes2/variables_are_references.html">Variables are references</a>), we noted that variables don't store objects themselves, but rather store references to objects. Recall also that we can use the python <code>id()</code> function to find the memory address where the objects are stored.</p>
<p>Consider the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Point:

    def __init__(self, x, y):
        # initialize the values of the point (x, y)
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __eq__(self, other: Point)-&gt;bool:
        return self.x==other.x and self.y==other.y

        return f&quot;({self.x}, {self.y})&quot;

# main code block:
point1 = Point(3, 5)
point2 = Point(3, 5)
point3 = point2
print(id(point1))
print(id(point2))
print(id(point3))
</code></pre>
<p>Since <code>point1</code> and <code>point2</code> were instantiated separately, they refer to two different objects. These objects are stored at different memory locations, so their ids are different (even though their contents are the same). On the other hand, <code>point3</code> refers to the same object as <code>point2</code>, so they have the same id.</p>
<p>Python provides another way to determine if two variables refer to the same object, using the keyword <code>is</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(point1 is point2) # outputs False, because point1 and point2 have different ids (they refer to different objects)
print(point2 is point3) # outputs True, because point2 and point3 have the same ids (they refer to the same object)
print(point1 is point3) # outputs False, because point1 and point3 have different ids (they refer to different objects)
</code></pre>
<h2 id="equality"><a class="header" href="#equality">Equality</a></h2>
<p>If rather than comparing identities, we want to determine if the contents of the objects are the same, recall that we learned to use <code>==</code>, which automatically calls the <code>__eq__()</code> method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(point1 == point2) # outputs True, because the x and y values for point1 and point2 are the same.
print(point2 == point3) # outputs True, because the x and y values for point2 and point3 are the same.

<p>In a previous section (<a href="chapters/classes2/variables_are_references.html">Variables are references</a>), we learned that variables hold references to objects (i.e., a variable contains the memory address where the object itself is stored), and we learned how to draw memory diagram to represent this. Trace the following code and predict the output as a review of these concepts:</p>
<h2 id="a-simple-example"><a class="header" href="#a-simple-example">A simple example</a></h2>
<p>Consider the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Point:

    def __init__(self, x, y):
        # initialize the values of the point (x, y)
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __str__(self)-&gt;str:
        # format the string in (x, y) form
        return f&quot;({self.x}, {self.y})&quot;
    
class Triangle:

    def __init__(self, v1: Point, v2: Point, v3: Point):

# main code block:
p1 = Point(4, 1)
p2 = p1
p1.x += 1

<p>The memory diagram below shows the state of the objects right before the code <code>p1.x += 1</code> executes:</p>
<img src="chapters/classes2/memory_diagram_5.png" alt="memory diagram of two variables referring to the same Point objects" width = 350>
<p>After the line <code>p1.x += 1</code> executes, the instance variable <code>x</code> in object that <code>p1</code> refers to is changed:</p>
<img src="chapters/classes2/memory_diagram_6.png" alt="another memory diagram of two variables referring to the same Point objects" width = 350>
<p>But notice that <code>p1</code> and <code>p2</code> refer to the same object (they have the same identity, i.e., <code>p1 is p2</code> is <code>True</code>), so when we output <code>p2</code>, we see that same change reflected. Thus the output is <code>(5,1)</code>. Drawing a memory diagram helps us trace more carefully through the code.</p>
<h2 id="a-more-complicated-example"><a class="header" href="#a-more-complicated-example">A more complicated example</a></h2>
<p>Now let's instantiate a <code>Triangle</code> object, which is more complicated since it has instance variables that are themselves objects. These instance variables are themselves references.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># main code block
p1 = Point(4, 1)
p2 = Point(7, 1)
p3 = Point(5, 2)
t1 = Triangle(p1, p2, p3)
</code></pre>
<p>Here's a diagram showing the state of memory after the above code executes. Examine each box and arrow carefully. Notice in particular that each of the vertex instance variables refer to objects, so they each contain an arrow that points to a <code>Point</code> object. Notice also that <code>p1</code>, <code>p1</code> and <code>p3</code> are part of the diagram, and they refer to the same <code>Point</code> objects as are stored in the <code>Triangle</code> <code>t1</code>.</p>
<img src="chapters/classes2/memory_diagram_7.png" alt="Memory diagram of a triangle object, which has three vertices that are each Point objects" width = 550>
<p>Aided by the above memory diagram, trace through the following code, to be run after the main code block above, and predict its output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">p1.x = 10
t1.vertex3.y = 19

<p>Answer:</p>
<pre><code>p3: (5, 19)

<p>Since <code>p1</code> refers to the same object as <code>t1.vertex1</code>, when <code>p1</code> is changed, so is <code>t1.vertex1</code>. Similarly, since <code>t1.vertex3</code> refers to the same object as <code>p3</code>, when <code>t1.vertex3</code> is changed, so is <code>p3</code>. Here is the final memory diagram showing the changes:</p>

<p>There are three levels of copying an object:</p>
<ul>
<li>copy a reference</li>
<li>shallow copy</li>
<li>deep copy</li>
</ul>
<p>In the explanations below, we will refer to the following classes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Point:

    def __init__(self, x: float, y: float):
        # initialize the values of the point (x, y)
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

</code></pre>
<h2 id="copy-a-reference"><a class="header" href="#copy-a-reference">Copy a reference</a></h2>
<p>You've already seen the idea of copying a reference. Consider this code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">p1 = Point(4, 1)
p2 = p1
p1.x = 5
print(p2.x) # outputs 5
</code></pre>
<p>In the first line above, a <code>Point</code> object called <code>p1</code> is instantiated. Since <code>p1</code> is actually a reference to the <code>Point</code> object, the next line makes a copy of that reference. Thus <code>p1</code> and <code>p2</code> refer to the same object. In the third line, the <code>x</code> instance variable of <code>p1</code> is changed. Since <code>p2</code> refers to the same object, on line 4, naturally <code>p2.x</code> also has the value 5.  Here is the memory diagram showing the situation:</p>
<table>
<tr><td>Before:</td><td>After:</td></tr>
<tr>

</tr>
</table>
<h2 id="shallow-copy"><a class="header" href="#shallow-copy">Shallow copy</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes we don't want to copy a reference, but instead we want to make a true copy of an object. The first way to do this in python is with a shallow copy, implemented in the <code>copy</code> function from python's <code>copy</code> module. To use this function, call <code>copy.copy(original_object)</code>, and it returns a new object of the same type, with each instance variable copied from the original. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import copy
original_point = Point(17, 23)
new_point = copy.copy(original_point)
original_point.y = 59
print(original_point)   # outputs (59, 23), it has been modified
print(new_point)        # outputs (17, 23), the copy was not modified
</code></pre>
<table>
<tr>
<td>After `new_point = copy.copy(originl_point)`</td>
<td>After `original_point.y = 59`:</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="chapters/classes2/shallow_copy1.png" alt="Point object, along with its shallow copy" width = 350></td>
<td><img src="chapters/classes2/shallow_copy2.png" alt="Point object has been modified, and the copy is unchanged" width = 350></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Notice <code>new_point</code> is a copy of the original. It is a separate object. Though its values are the same, it has a different id. Thus, when the value of <code>original_point.y</code> is changed, that change will not affect <code>new_point</code>.</p>
<h2 id="a-shallow-copy-is-not-always-ideal-since-it-only-copies-one-level-of-depth"><a class="header" href="#a-shallow-copy-is-not-always-ideal-since-it-only-copies-one-level-of-depth">A shallow copy is not always ideal, since it only copies one level of depth</a></h2>
<p>Let's look at what a shallow copy does on a more complex object:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Create Triangle object and make a shallow copy of it
t1 = Triangle(Point(4, 1), Point(7, 1), Point(5, 2))
t2 = copy.copy(t1)   # shallow copy!
print(t1)            # outputs Vertices: (4, 1) (7, 1) (5, 2)
print(t2)            # outputs Vertices: (4, 1) (7, 1) (5, 2)
</code></pre>
<p>Let's examine in detail what happens with the shallow copy. Start with the memory diagram for <code>t1</code>:
<img src="chapters/classes2/shallow_copy3.png" alt="One triangle, before copy" width = 450></p>
<p>Recall that a shallow copy will copy each instance variable of an object. The three instance variables for <code>t1</code> are each references (<code>t1.vertex1</code>, <code>t1.vertex2</code>, and <code>t1.vertex3</code>). So all three of these references get copied to the new object <code>t2</code>. Copying the three references does not create new objects. The result is that <code>t2</code>'s instance variables(<code>t2.vertex1</code>, <code>t2.vertex2</code>, and <code>t2.vertex3</code>) point to the same <code>Point</code> objects as <code>t1</code>. The two triangles share these <code>Point</code> objects!</p>
<img src="chapters/classes2/shallow_copy4.png" alt="Two triangles, after shallow copy" width = 450>
<p>The shallow copy works fine when we change one of the instance variables of the original object (i.e., replace one of the vertex <code>Point</code>s)</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Change the first vertex of t1 to a new Point object:
t1.vertex1 = Point(3, -1)
print(t1)  # The triangle has been modified to Vertices: (3, -1) (7, 1) (5, 2)
print(t2)  # still outputs Vertices: (4, 1) (7, 1) (5, 2)
</code></pre>
<p>The behavior still makes sense - the copied triangle does not change when the first triangle is modified. Here is the memory diagram after the above code has been executed. Notice that <code>t1.vertex1</code> now refers to a brand-new <code>Point</code>.</p>
<img src="chapters/classes2/shallow_copy5.png" alt="Two triangles, after shallow copy, modified instance variables" width = 450>
<p>But the behavior of the shallow copy doesn't satisfy our needs in this case when we change intance variables in the underlying <code>Point</code> objects:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">t1.vertex3.y = 0
print(t1)    # As expected, y value of last vertex is modified: Vertices: (3, -1) (7, 1) (5, 0)
print(t2)    # t2 is a copy, yet the value of its last vertex also changed: Vertices: (4, 1) (7, 1) (5, 0)
</code></pre>
<p>Here is the memory diagram after the last segment of code has run. Notice that the y-coordinate of <code>vertex3</code> has been modified, for both triangles.</p>
<img src="chapters/classes2/shallow_copy6.png" alt="Two triangles, after shallow copy, modified deeper" width = 450>
<p>We see that for objects with more than one level, a shallow copy might lead to unwanted side effects when changing values on the second level or deeper. To solve this problem, the python <code>copy</code> module provides a function called <code>deepcopy()</code>.</p>
<h2 id="deep-copy"><a class="header" href="#deep-copy">Deep copy</a></h2>
<p>A call to <code>copy.deepcopy(original_object)</code> returns an new object that is a full copy of <code>original_object</code>. Any object that <code>original_object</code> refers to is also copied. This instantiation of copies happens at every level of depth of the object being copied.</p>
<p>For example, consider this code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">orig = Triangle(Point(1, 6), Point(5, 3), Point(1, 3))
copied = copy.deepcopy(orig)
</code></pre>
<p>Here's a memory diagram of the two objects after the deep copy:</p>
<img src="chapters/classes2/deep_copy.png" alt="Two triangles, after deep copy" width = 450>
<p>Notice that the three <code>Point</code>s representing the vertices of the original triangle all got copied.
The deep copy completely detaches connection between the two objects. So modifications made to one of the triangles cannot possibly affect the other triangle. For example, the code below swaps out a new point for <code>orig.vertex1</code>, and also changes an individual component of <code>orig.vertex3</code>. Neither of these affect the <code>copied</code> triangle.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">orig.vertex1 = Point(3, -1)
orig.vertex3.y = 0
</code></pre>
<img src="chapters/classes2/deep_copy_modified.png" alt="Two triangles, after deep copy and modification of one the original" width = 450>
<p>Side note: in the above memory diagram, <code>orig.vertex1</code> was changed to a newly-instantiated <code>Point</code>. This means that there are no longer any arrows pointing to the initial point <code>orig.vertex1</code>. Since there are no remaining references to this point, it can no longer be accessed from within this program. Python &quot;cleans up&quot; these orphaned objects through a process called <em>garbage collection</em>. Garbage collection recovers space in memory to potentially be used by python later in the running of the program.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="inheritance"><a class="header" href="#inheritance">Inheritance</a></h1>
<p>Inheritance is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming. The idea is to relate two classes, allowing one to access (and thus &quot;inherit&quot;) the data attributes and method attributes of the other. This powerful technique allows us to reuse base code that can then be shared by one or several classes.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="inheritance-1"><a class="header" href="#inheritance-1">Inheritance</a></h1>
<h2 id="the-purpose-of-inheritance"><a class="header" href="#the-purpose-of-inheritance">The purpose of inheritance</a></h2>
<p>Suppose we want to create classes to represent objects from a general category (such as shapes), where each object also belongs to a more specific category (such as circles, rectangles, or ellipses). Rather than make several unrelated classes, we instead model the situation with the following class diagram:</p>
<center>
<img src="chapters/inheritance/class_diagram_inheritance.png" alt="memory diagram of two variables referring to the same Point objects" width = 350 class = "center">
</center>
<p>The above diagram implies that <code>Shape</code>, <code>Circle</code>, <code>Rectangle</code> and <code>Ellipse</code> are all classes. It also implies that <code>Circle</code>, <code>Rectangle</code> and <code>Ellipse</code> automatically inherit the attributes (instance variables and methods) from the <code>Shape</code> class. So, for example, every object of the <code>Circle</code> class automatically has the same instance variables and methods as every <code>Shape</code> object, in addition to further instance variables and methods that are specific to <code>Circle</code>s. The same holds for <code>Rectangle</code>s and <code>Ellipse</code>s, which each need further instance variables and methods that are different from <code>Circle</code>. For example, <code>Shape</code> could have <code>self.center_x</code>, <code>self.center_y</code> and <code>self.color</code> as attributes, while <code>Circle</code> would have the additional instance variable <code>self.radius</code>. <code>Rectangle</code> objects on the other hand would have <code>self.width</code> and <code>self.height</code>, and <code>Ellipse</code> would have <code>self.x_radius</code> and <code>self.y_radius</code>. The key idea here is that <code>Circle</code>, <code>Rectangle</code> and <code>Ellipse</code> all have the attributes of <code>Shape</code>, plus attributes belonging just to their class. This is the idea of inheritance.</p>
<p>In the above example, <code>Shape</code> is called the <em>base class</em>, and <code>Circle</code>, <code>Rectangle</code> and <code>Triangle</code> are called <em>derived classes</em>. Base classes are also often called <em>parent classes</em> or <em>superclasses</em>, and derived classes are called <em>child classes</em> or <em>subclasses</em>.</p>
<h2 id="implementing-inheritance"><a class="header" href="#implementing-inheritance">Implementing inheritance</a></h2>
<p>To indicate the base class/derived class relationship (parent/child relationship or superclass/subclass relationship), when defining the derived class, we put its base class name in parenthesis. Here's the template for defining inheritance:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class BaseClass:
    pass

class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>Very commonly within the definition of methods in the derived class, we need the base class to do part of the work, since the base class is responsible for the shared instance variables. Typically we do this by invoking methods from the base class, using the expression <code>super().method_name()</code>. The following example shows a partial implementation of the <code>Shape</code>, <code>Circle</code> and <code>Rectangle</code> classes described above.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Shape:

    def __init__(self, x: float, y: float, c: dudraw.Color):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.color = c

class Circle(Shape):

    # The __init__() method calls on its parent class to do part of the initialization work
    def __init__(self, x: float, y: float, r: float, c: dudraw.Color):
        super().__init__(x, y, c)
        self.radius = r

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, x: float, y: float, w: float, h: float, c: dudraw.Color):
        super().__init__(x, y, c)
        self.width = w
        self.height = h

# The Ellipse class is left to you to define
</code></pre>
<p>Key points from the above code:</p>
<ul>
<li>The line <code>class Circle(Shape)</code> defines <code>Circle</code> as a derived class of <code>Shape</code>. Similar for <code>Rectangle</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>__init__()</code> method in <code>Shape</code> creates three instance variables. Every <code>Circle</code> object automatically inherits these instance variables.</li>
<li>The <code>Circle</code> class begins its <code>__init__()</code> method by calling on its base class (parent class) <code>Shape</code> to perform its own initialization process. The call <code>super().__init__()</code> invokes the <code>__init__()</code> method of the base class <code>Shape</code>. The initial values for the relevant instance variables are passed to that method of the base class.</li>
<li>Note: You may also see the base class (parent) <code>__init__()</code> being called with <code>BaseClassName.__init__(self)</code>. Since python 3, this is less preferred.</li>
<li>The <code>Circle</code> class continues initialization by creating its own instance variable <code>self.radius</code>.</li>
<li>Each derived class (child class) goes through the same process: Ask the super class to do its part of the initialization, then create the instance variables specific to this derived classes.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is a very typical pattern for methods in a derived class to first call on the base class to do part of the work, then to do the part of the work that is specific to this derived class. For example, here we see an implementation of the <code>__str__()</code> method in both the base class and one of the derived class.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Shape:

    def __init__(self, x: float, y: float, c: dudraw.Color):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.color = c

    def __str__(self)-&gt;str:
        # the &quot;.4g&quot; formatting specification outputs at most 4 decimal places
        return f&quot;center: ({self.x:.4g}, {self.y:.4g}), color: {self.color}&quot;

class Circle(Shape):

    def __init__(self, x: float, y: float, r: float, c: dudraw.Color):
        super().__init__(x, y, c)
        self.radius = r

    # The __str__() method calls its parent class Shape to do part of the formatting work
    def __str__(self)-&gt;str:
        return f&quot;{super().__str__()}, circle radius: {self.radius:.3g}&quot;


# The __str__() methods for Rectangle and Ellipse are left to you
</code></pre>
<p>Consider the following instantiation and output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">shape1 = Shape(0.6, 0.2, dudraw.BLUE)
print(shape1)
circle1 = Circle(0.5, 0.25, 0.075, dudraw.RED)
print(circle1)
</code></pre>
<p>Tracing through this code: </p>
<ul>
<li>When <code>shape1</code> is instantiated, the <code>__init__()</code> method for <code>Shape</code> is called.</li>
<li>When the line <code>print(shape1)</code> executes, the <code>__str__()</code> method for <code>Shape</code> is called.</li>
<li>When <code>circle1</code> is instantiated, the <code>__init__()</code> method for <code>Circle</code> is automatically invoked. It then calls the <code>__init__()</code> method for the base class (superclass) <code>Shape</code> before initializing its own instance variable <code>self.radius</code>.</li>
<li>in the line <code>print(circle1)</code>, the <code>__str__()</code> method for the <code>Circle</code> class is automatically called. It in turn calls the <code>__str__()</code> method for its base class (<code>Shape</code>), which builds the first part of the string. Control is returned to the <code>__str__()</code> method for the derived class <code>Circle</code>, which builds the second part of the string, defining the radius. The full string is then returned to the caller.
Output:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>center: (0.6, 0.2), color: (0, 0, 255)
center: (0.5, 0.25), color: (255, 0, 0), circle radius: 0.075
</code></pre>
<p>While it is a common pattern for the base class to call on its <code>super()</code> to do part of the work of a method, it is not the only pattern. Another option is <em>method overriding</em>, explained in the next section.</p>

<p>Consider the following implementation of the <code>Shape</code> and <code>Circle</code> classes:</p>

    def draw(self):

circle1 = Circle(0.5, 0.25, 0.075, dudraw.RED)
circle1.draw()
dudraw.show(10000)
</code></pre>
<p>Trace the main code block carefully. Notice that we instantiate a <code>Shape</code> object called <code>shape1</code>. It has instance variables <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>color</code>. When <code>shape1.draw()</code> is called, a point is drawn to the (x, y) location, in the right color. Then a <code>Circle</code> object called <code>circle1</code> is instantiated, and its instance variables are initialized. Notice it has instance variables <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>color</code> inherited from its parent class <code>Shape</code>, as well as an instance variable for its radius. On the next line, you might be fooled by the call <code>circle1.draw()</code>. If you're thinking that the program will crash on that line, since the <code>Circle</code> class does not have a <code>draw()</code> method, you've forgotten that <code>Circle</code> <em>inherits all attributes</em> from <code>Shape</code>. So the <code>draw()</code> method from <code>Shape</code> gets called!  Sadly, <code>Shape</code>'s <code>draw()</code> method just draws a point. This is not how we want to draw a circle. The solution is to <em>override</em> the <code>draw()</code> method.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-override-methods"><a class="header" href="#how-to-override-methods">How to override methods</a></h2>
<p>Not much to it: just implement a <code>draw()</code> method in <code>Circle</code> that does the task specific to <code>Circle</code> objects. Although <code>Circle</code> already had a <code>draw()</code> method (the one it inherited from <code>Shape</code>), we provide a second <code>draw()</code> method within the definition of <code>Circle</code>, and that method overrides the one in its parent class (base class).</p>

<p>For reference, here is another example. Trace the following code carefully and predict the output. To learn well from this example, in the main code block pay close attention to which version of each method gets called. Sometimes the method in the child class calls the parent to do some of the work, and sometimes the method in the child class fully overrides the

<p>Object-oriented-programming really shines with the idea of polymorphism. The idea is simple and powerful. Recall in previous sections we saw that multiple classes that are related by inheritance could use method overriding so that each has a different version of a method with the same name. This means that if we have several of these objects, all of which potentially have different types, we can still sensibly store them all in one list. Then we can traverse that list, and call the method for each of them. The correct method will get called for each of them, based on each object's individual type.</p>
<h1 id="example-2"><a class="header" href="#example-2">Example</a></h1>

</code></pre>
<p>The implementation of these classes is the same as in the previous section. 
After orienting yourself to the code for the classes, please focus on the main code block.</p>
<p>In it, an empty list called <code>shapes</code> is first created. 
This list will hold references to a variety of different types of <code>Shape</code> objects.
Each time through the for-loop, a <code>Shape</code>, <code>Circle</code>, <code>Rectangle</code> and <code>Ellipse</code> object are instantiated and each appended to the list.
Note the key point here: the list <code>shapes</code> holds four different types of objects, we can treat them homogeneously. 
This is the concept of polymorphism!</p>
<p>After the list has been created, the next for-loop traverses the list and displays each object. 
The call <code>shape.draw()</code> works seamlessly, but don't miss the magic here: a different version of the <code>draw()</code> method is called depending on which type of object it is.
If the object is of the type <code>Shape</code>, then the <code>draw()</code> method in the parent class <code>Shape</code> is called. 
Otherwise, the appropriate overriding method is automatically invoked instead.
The last for-loop demonstrates another example of the same idea. 
This time, the <code>__str__()</code> method is called, depending on the type of the object.
If it is a <code>Shape</code>, then the <code>__str__()</code> method of the parent class is called.
But when it is one of the child classes, the child class's overriding version of <code>__str__()</code> is called. 
Each <code>__str__()</code> method in the child classes invokes the <code>__str__()</code> method of the parent to do the parent's part of the job.</p>

<p>You learned about the python <code>type()</code> function in the first weeks of programming. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">age = 5
movie_title = &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;
print(type(age))          # outputs &lt;class 'int'&gt;
print(type(movie_title))  # outputs &lt;class 'str'&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This idea extends to objects of user-defined classes. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Shape:

    def __init__(self, x: float, y: float, c: dudraw.Color):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.color = c

class Circle(Shape):

    def __init__(self, x: float, y: float, r: float, c: dudraw.Color):
        super().__init__(x, y, c)
        self.radius = r

# main code block:
shape1 = Shape(0.25, 0.75, dudraw.ORANGE)
circle1 = Circle(0.5, 0.5, 0.2, dudraw.RED)
print(type(circle1)) # outputs &lt;class '__main__.Circle'&gt;
print(type(shape1))  # outputs &lt;class '__main__.Shape'&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>(The output is not simply <code>&lt;class Circle&gt;</code>, but rather includes <code>__main__</code>, which is the module name where the <code>Circle</code> class was defined.)</p>
<p>The python <code>type()</code> function returns the name of class that the object was instantiated as. But by virtue of inheritance, note that <code>circle1</code> is both a <code>Circle</code> and a <code>Shape</code>. To elicit this information from program control, we can use python's <code>isinstance()</code> function. The <code>isinstance()</code> function takes two parameters: the first is an object, and the second is a class. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(isinstance(circle1, Circle))  # True (circle1 was instantiated as a Circle)
print(isinstance(circle1, Shape))   # True, by inheritance. Every Circle is a Shape
print(isinstance(shape1, Shape))    # True (shape1 was instantiated as a Shape)
print(isinstance(shape1, Circle))   # False, shape1 is not an instance of the child class Circle

<p>In object-oriented programming (OOP), there are multiple ways that classes can interact. We've seen two of them: inheritance (in which one class <em>is</em> an extension of another class) and composition (in which one class <em>has</em> instance variables of another class). Inheritance is informally referred to as an &quot;is a&quot; relationship (since an object of a derived class is <em>also automatically</em> an instance of its parent class). Composition is informally referred to as a &quot;has a&quot; relationship (since the class owns, or has, instances of another class). To illustrate the difference, here are two examples from previoius sections.</p>
<h2 id="inheritance-relationship"><a class="header" href="#inheritance-relationship">Inheritance relationship</a></h2>
<p>In the example below, <code>Circle</code> is a derived class (child class) of <code>Shape</code>, as indicated by the class definition: <code>class Circle(Shape)</code>. The relationship is an example of inheritance.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Shape:

    def __init__(self, x: float, y: float, c: dudraw.Color):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.color = c

class Circle(Shape):

    def __init__(self, x: float, y: float, r: float, c: dudraw.Color):
        super().__init__(x, y, c)
        self.radius = r

# main code block:
circle1 = Circle(0.5, 0.5, 0.2, dudraw.RED)
print(type(circle1))               # circle1 is of type Circle
print(isinstance(circle1, Circle)) # True: circle1 is an instance of Circle
print(isinstance(circle1, Shape))  # True: circle1 is an instance of Shape, by inheritance
</code></pre>
<p>In the above example, the type of <code>circle1</code> is <code>Circle</code>. Python outputs
<code>&lt;class '__main__.Circle'&gt;</code> (since the <code>Circle</code> class is defined within the <code>__main__</code> module).
The next line determines if <code>circle1</code> is an instance of the <code>Circle</code> class, which it is since it was instantiated as a <code>Circle</code> object.
The final line determines if <code>circle1</code> is also an instance of the <code>Shape</code> class. The result is again <code>True</code>. The object <code>circle1</code> is a <code>Circle</code>, and thus is also a <code>Shape</code>, since <code>Circle</code> is a child clcass of <code>Shape</code>.</p>
<h2 id="composition-relationship"><a class="header" href="#composition-relationship">Composition relationship</a></h2>
<p>Here is an abridged version of code from a previous section (<a href="chapters/inheritance/../classes1/complicated_classes.html">More complex classes</a>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Point:

    def __init__(self, x: float, y: float):
        # initialize the values of the point (x, y)
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

class Triangle:

    def __init__(self, v1: Point, v2: Point, v3: Point):
        self.vertex1 = v1
        self.vertex2 = v2
        self.vertex3 = v3

# main code block
t1 = Triangle(Point(5, 2), Point(2, 5), Point(2, 2))
print(type(t1))
print(isinstance(t1, Triangle))  # True, t1 is a triangle
print(isinstance(t1, Point))     # False, t1 is not a Point
</code></pre>
<p>In the above code, we have two classes, but they are not related by inheritance. Instead, they are related by composition, since the <code>Triangle</code> class uses the <code>Point</code> class by owning instance variables of type <code>Point</code>. </p>
<p>In the main code block, note that the type of <code>t1</code> is <code>Triangle</code>
(python outputs <code>&lt;class '__main__.Triangle'&gt;</code>, since the <code>Triangle</code> class is defined within the <code>__main__</code> module). The next line determines if <code>t1</code> is an instance of the <code>Triangle</code> class, which it is, since <code>t1</code> was instantiated as a <code>Triangle</code>. The final line, however, outputs <code>False</code>. The object <code>t1</code> <em>is not a</em> <code>Point</code>. Rather, it <em>has a</em> <code>Point</code> as one of its instance variables.</p>

<p>Key points in the code example above:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider the flow of information when instantiating an object of a grandchild class. For example, when instantiating an <code>AudioBook</code>, the <code>__init__()</code> method calls <code>super().__init__()</code>, which invokes the <code>__init__()</code> method for <code>Book</code>. But then the <code>__init__()</code> method for <code>Book</code> in turn calls <code>super().__init__()</code>, which invokes the <code>__init__()</code> method for <code>Publication</code>. So the information goes up the chain to the top-level class.</li>
<li>A similar process occurs when the <code>Audiobook</code>'s <code>__str__()</code> method is called. It calls its parent's <code>__str__()</code> method, and that method in turn calls its parent's <code>__str__()</code> method. At each level the string is computed and returned down the chain, where it is combined with the string information passed back from the level above.</li>
<li>In the main code block,  a list is created that holds a variety of objects from the 5 defined classes. Since regardless of type, each is also an instance of the <code>Publication</code> class, they can be treated in a homogenous way. Thus the for-loop can seamlessly traverse the objects and print them, even though they are potentially all of different subclasses.</li>
<li>Predict what will be output by the following code:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(type(publications[2]))
print(isinstance(publications[1], Book))
print(isinstance(publications[3], Book))
print(isinstance(publications[2], Publication))

<p>Recursion is a fundamental concept in Computer Science. Its a problem-solving technique that is an alternative to iteration (loops). Recursion applies whenever you can break a problem down into the same problem, but with smaller inputs. Recursion is important because there are some computational problems whose solutions are fantastically easier using recursion. You will see recursion again many times in your Computer Science journey.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="recursion-1"><a class="header" href="#recursion-1">Recursion</a></h1>
<p>Background: In order to fully comprehend the idea of recursion, it's essential that you fully understand how the call stack works in tracking function calls. Please make sure you are solid on <a href="chapters/recursion/../functions/call_stack.html">call stack memory diagrams</a></p>
<h2 id="the-idea-of-recursion"><a class="header" href="#the-idea-of-recursion">The idea of recursion</a></h2>
<p>You're very familiar with the idea that a function can call on (invoke) another function to perform a subtask for it. The beautiful, powerful, and mind-blowing idea of recursion is that a function can actually call <em>itself</em> to perform a subtask.</p>
<h2 id="tracing-through-a-recursive-function-first-example"><a class="header" href="#tracing-through-a-recursive-function-first-example">Tracing through a recursive function, first example</a></h2>
<p>As a first recursion example, consider the following code. Notice that on line 6 the function <code>recursion_example()</code> make a call to <em>itself</em>, with the value of the parameter reduced by 1:</p>
<img src="chapters/recursion/first_recursion.png" alt="first example of a recursive function" width="300"/> 
<p>Let's trace through this function carefully, building a call stack. On line 12 <code>main()</code> is called, and then on line 9, <code>recursion_example()</code> is called with an argument of 2, putting us on line 1 of the program. Here's an image of the call stack at that moment:</p>
<img src="chapters/recursion/recursion_callstack1.png" alt="first call stack in recursion example" width="200"/>
<p>On line 2, we see n is not less than or equal to 0, so we proceed to the else block. On line 5, the number 2 is output to the terminal. On line 6, we call <code>recursion_example()</code>, this time with an argument of 1. We jump to line 1 of the code, but notice this is a new function call. This means a new frame must get pushed onto the call stack. The call stack now has <em>two</em> frames with calls to <code>recursion_example()</code>:</p>
<img src="chapters/recursion/recursion_callstack2.png" alt="second call stack in recursion example" width="200"/>
<p>We proceed again to line 2, we see n is not less than or equal to 0 this time either, so we proceed to the else block. On line 5, the number 1 is output to the terminal, On line 6, we call <code>recursion_example()</code>, this time with an argument of 0. We jump to line 1 of the code, but notice this is a yet a new function call! This means yet a new frame must get pushed onto the call stack. The call stack now has <em>three</em> frames with calls to <code>recursion_example()</code>:</p>
<img src="chapters/recursion/recursion_callstack3.png" alt="third call stack in recursion example" width="200"/>
<p>Just when you feared this process would go on forever, we see that this time on line 2, n <em>is</em> less than or equal to 0. We call this a <em>base case</em>, which stops the recursion. So on line 3 we return from the most recent call. When we return from a call to a function, the top frame is popped off of the stack, so we can continue executing from where we left off in the calling function. Here's the call stack with the top frame popped, putting us back into our second call to <code>recursion_example()</code>, on line 6:</p>
<img src="chapters/recursion/recursion_callstack2.png" alt="fourth call stack in recursion example" width="200"/>
<p>But this is the last line of the function, so we return to the caller, popping the top frame off of the stack:</p>
<img src="chapters/recursion/recursion_callstack1.png" alt="fifth call stack in recursion example" width="200"/>
<p>We are back on line 6 of our first call to <code>recursion_exaple()</code>. But this is the last line of the function, so we return to the calling function <code>main()</code>, popping the top frame off of the stack:</p>
<img src="chapters/recursion/recursion_callstack4.png" alt="last call stack in recursion example" width="200"/>
<p>This is the last line of the function, and the program is complete. Notice how the call stack built up through the recursion, as the function was called repeatedly. Then, as each instance of the function completed, the call stack rewinds, until execution is complete.</p>
<h2 id="tracing-through-a-recursive-function-second-example"><a class="header" href="#tracing-through-a-recursive-function-second-example">Tracing through a recursive function, second example</a></h2>
<p>Consider the following code, using a second example of a recursive function:</p>
<img src="chapters/recursion/second_recursion.png" alt="second example of a recursive function, no base case" width="300"/> 
<p>On line 8 <code>main()</code> is called, which on line 5 calls the function <code>yuck(5, 3)</code>. At this point, our call stack looks like this:</p>
<img src="chapters/recursion/recursion2_callstack1.png" alt="Call stack 1 for yucky recursion" width="200"/>
<p>Next, line 2 is executed, which calls <code>yuck(5, 2)</code>:</p>
<img src="chapters/recursion/recursion2_callstack2.png" alt="Call stack 2 for yucky recursion" width="200"/>
<p>The process seems to proceeding smoothly, like the previous example. Next, line 2 is executed, which calls <code>yuck(5, 1)</code>:</p>
<img src="chapters/recursion/recursion2_callstack3.png" alt="Call stack 2 for yucky recursion" width="200"/>
<p>We continue on. Next line 2 is executed, which calls <code>yuck(5, 0)</code>:</p>
<img src="chapters/recursion/recursion2_callstack4.png" alt="Call stack 2 for yucky recursion" width="200"/>
<p>Now line 2 is executed, which calls <code>yuck(5, -1)</code>. At this point we begin to realize that this time the recursive process will not ever stop. The stack will just keep growing larger and larger, never returning. Yuck! This is called <em>infinite recursion</em>, and happens whenever we fail to provide a base case to stop the recursion. This bug results in the program eventually crashing, with a recursion error, and the message</p>
<pre><code>RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded
</code></pre>
<p>To avoid this problem, every recursive function must contain conditions to stop the recursion in at least one base case.</p>
<p>In the next section you will see some examples of implementing recursive functions that perform useful and interesting tasks.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="implementing-recursive-functions"><a class="header" href="#implementing-recursive-functions">Implementing recursive functions</a></h1>
<p>You can implement a recursive algorithm any time you can break a computation down into one or more parts that involve the same computation, but with smaller values. This is known as a <em>recursive relationship</em>. In addition to the recursive relationship, you also always need a <em>base case</em>, which tells you when to stop the recursion.</p>
<h2 id="example-1---computing-powers"><a class="header" href="#example-1---computing-powers">Example 1 - computing powers</a></h2>
<p>Suppose you want to write a function called <code>power()</code> that evaluates an exponential expression \(a^n\). For example, we want the line</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(power(2, 5))
</code></pre>
<p>to output the number 32 (since \(2^5 = 32\)). You already should know how to implement this iteratively (i.e., using a for-loop - try it for practice!). We'll now see how to implement it using recursion. Suppose we already knew the value of \(2^4\). Then it would be trivial to compute \(2^5\): since \(2^5 = 2^4*2\), we would simply multiply \(2^4\) by 2. So within the implementation of the <code>power()</code> function, when computing \(2^5\), we call the <code>power()</code> function to perform the subtask of computing \(2^4\). More generally, <code>power(a, n)</code> is just <code>power(a, n-1)*a</code>. This line of code expresses the mathematical recursive relationship \(a^n = a\cdot a^{n-1}\). Here's a partial (and flawed!) implementation that uses this idea:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def power(a, n):
    return power(a, n-1)*a
</code></pre>
<p>To see the flaw with the above code, imagine the call <code>power(2, 0)</code>, which should just return the value 1. Instead, it attempts to return <code>2*power(2, -1)</code>. When <code>power(2, -1)</code> is called, the expression <code>2*power(2, -2)</code> must be evaluated. In turn, to evaluate <code>power(2, -2)</code>, the the expression <code>2*power(2, -3)</code> must be computed. Notice that the exponent will continue to decrease, and we will recurse infinitely, crashing with a <code>RecursionError</code>. This demonstrates the need for a <em>base case</em>. When the exponent is 0, rather than making a recursive call, instead we should simply return the value 1. Here's code that includes the base case:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def power(a, n):
    # base case:
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    # recursive call:
    else:
        return power(a, n-1)*a

# main code block:
print(power(2, 5)) # correctly outputs 32
</code></pre>
<p>Other than error-checking (n must be a positive integer for this code to work), this is a correct and complete implementation. To summarize the key facts we needed to implement this function:</p>
<ul>
<li>base case: \(a^0=1\)</li>
<li>recursive relationship: \(a^n = a^{n-1} * a\)</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice how these two components appear as different cases in the code.</p>
<h2 id="example-2---computing-factorials"><a class="header" href="#example-2---computing-factorials">Example 2 - computing factorials</a></h2>
<p>Now we will implement the factorial function. Recall that the factorial of a non-negative integer n is written n!, and it is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example, \(5! = 5\cdot4\cdot3\cdot2\cdot1\). Note that 1! = 1 and 0! = 1. Finally, note that there is a relationship between a factorial value and the one before it. For example, \(5! = 5 \cdot 4!\).
As always with recursion, we start by identifying the recursive relationship, and the base case:</p>
<ul>
<li>base case: 0! = 1</li>
<li>recursive relationship: \(n! = n\cdot (n-1)!\)</li>
</ul>
<p>These two components of the recursion translate directly to two cases in the implementation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def factorial(n: int):
    # base case:
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    # recursive call:
    else:
        return n*factorial(n-1)

# main code block:
print(f&quot;10! is {factorial(10):,}&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>10! is 3,628,800
</code></pre>
<h3 id="error-checking"><a class="header" href="#error-checking">Error-checking</a></h3>
<p>Notice that the code above does not do error-checking. Suppose we call factorial with a negative value:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(f&quot;uh-oh: {factorial(-1)}&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>By starting at a negative number, the base case is eluded, and the program crashes with the output <code>RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded</code>.</p>
<p>One might blame the caller for this error: factorials should not be computed for negative numbers. However, it is good programming practice to make our implementations robust against errors by the caller. One way to fix it is to return -1 to indicate an error state if a negative number is passed to factorial:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def factorial(n: int):
    # check for errors:
    if n &lt; 0:
        return -1
    # base case:
    elif n == 0:
        return 1
    # recursive call:
    else:
        return n*factorial(n-1)
</code></pre>
<h2 id="example-3---computing-greatest-common-divisors"><a class="header" href="#example-3---computing-greatest-common-divisors">Example 3 - computing greatest common divisors</a></h2>
<h3 id="greatest-common-divisors-and-their-recursive-relationship"><a class="header" href="#greatest-common-divisors-and-their-recursive-relationship">Greatest common divisors and their recursive relationship</a></h3>
<p>It's common in Computer Science to need to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers. Recall that the greatest common divisor of two integers is the largest integer that divides both numbers. For example, gcd(25, 15) = 5, and gcd(60, 72) = 12. In grade school you learned how to find the gcd of two numbers by fully factoring each, and finding the overlap of the factors. For example, \(60 = 5\cdot3\cdot2\cdot2\) and \(72 = 3\cdot3\cdot2\cdot2\cdot2\). The shared factors are \(3\cdot2\cdot2\), so gcd(60, 72) = 12. </p>
<p>However, when integers are large, factoring becomes computationally intractible, so the factoring method of finding gcds is not feasible. Fortunately, there is a theorem for reducing the problem to a smaller size. Divide the larger number by the smaller number, and find the remainder.
Then the gcd of the original two numbers is the same as the gcd of the smaller number and the remainder. For example, \(72 = 1\cdot 60 + 12\), so gcd(72, 60) = gcd(60, 12). This new problem with smaller values is easier. Since 12 goes into 60 evenly, gcd(72, 60) = gcd(60, 12) = 12. Repeatedly applying this strategy is called <em>the Euclidean algorithm</em>. We can describe this algorithm for finding gcd(a,b) (where a &gt; b) as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>base case: if b divides a, then the answer is b. Note that b divides a if <code>a%b == 0</code></li>
<li>recursive relationship: gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, r), where r is the remainder when a is divided by b. Note that <code>r = a%b</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="implementing-the-gcd-function"><a class="header" href="#implementing-the-gcd-function">Implementing the <code>gcd()</code> function</a></h3>
<p>The recursive implementation of gcd is easy now that we have described the base case and the recursive relationship:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def gcd(a, b):
    # base case:
    if a%b == 0:
        return b
    # recursive call:
    else:
        return gcd(b, a%b)

# main code block:
print(gcd(60, 48)) # outputs 12
</code></pre>
<p>The above implementation is remarkable straight-forward! Note that it has some flaws that we have not checked or corrected:</p>
<ul>
<li>What if the a &lt; b?</li>
<li>What if one or both of the numbers are 0?</li>
<li>What if one or both of the numbers is negative?</li>
</ul>
<p>Completing the function to handle these errors is left to you.</p>

<p>Drawing fractals is a neat graphical application of recursion. Below is a drawing of a fractal called a <em>Sierpinski Gasket</em>, or <em>Sierpinski Triangle</em>:</p>
<img src="chapters/recursion/sierpinski.jpg" alt="Drawing of a Sierpinski Gasket" width="300"/> 
<p>Distinctive characteristics of a true fractal are:</p>
<ul>
<li>detail at all scales (zoom in as far as you like, and you still see the same level of detail), and</li>
<li>self-similarity (the image is made up of three triangles, each of which is a scaled-down version of the full triangle).</li>
</ul>
<p>Since we are drawing a computer image of a fractal, we do not actually see detail at all level. When we reach one pixel, we stop drawing further detail.</p>
<p>The self-similarity of the image is what enables us to draw the very complex image with a recursive function. This diagram shows how the figure comprises three miniature versions of itself. The three components of the fractal together create the image as a whole, and each component is itself a scaled-down replica of the larger image. The diagrams give the coordinates of each smaller sierpinski triangle relative to the larger whole.</p>

<p>Summarizing into the facts we need to build this drawing of a sierpinski triangle with coordinates (left, bottom), (right, top)</p>
<ul>
<li>base case: if the size is less than a defined cut-off, then draw a triangle with corners (left, bottom), (right, top)</li>
<li>recursive relationship: the larger triangle is created by drawing the following:
<ul>
<li>a sierpinski triangle with coordinates (left, bottom), ((left+right)/2, (bottom+top)/2)</li>
<li>a sierpinski triangle with coordinates ((left+right)/2, bottom), (right, (bottom+top)/2)</li>
<li>a sierpinski triangle with coordinates (left, (bottom+top)/2), ((right+left)/2, top)</li>

<p>During execution of a recursive function, the call stack is built. As we return from the recursive calls, the frames are popped off of the call stack, and the stack is unwound. The building of the call stack should be considered part of the computation, as the structure of the call stack often stores the information that will be processed as the stack is unwound. For example, consider the execution of the following code:</p>
<img src="chapters/recursion/factorial_6_screenshot.png" alt="Recursive implementation of factorial" width="300"/>
<p>Notice that the call to <code>factorial(6)</code> results in a stack of 8 recursive calls. Trace through it yourself to confirm this call stack is correct at the deepest level reached:</p>
<img src="chapters/recursion/factorial_6_callstack.png" alt="Stack of 7 frames when executing factorial(6)" width="150"/>
<p>The call stack has the values of n all lined up and ready to go - as we unwind the stack, each time the previous return value is multiplied by n, and that product is then returned to the next frame down the stack:</p>

<p>Consider the following code, with a call to a recursive function:</p>
<img src="chapters/recursion/down_up_code.png" alt="Tracing a recursive function" width="300"/>
<p>Notice there is a <code>print()</code> statement both before and after the recursive call. Before continuing reading, carefully trace the code (using a call stack) and determine the output. Pay close attention to the order of each output line.</p>
<p>First line 10 executes, and invokes <code>down_up(3)</code>. The base case is skipped, the code proceeding to line 5. The text <code>Entering down_up: 3</code> is output. Then on line 6, a recursive call is made <code>down_up(2)</code>. Entering that function, the base case is skipped again, the code proceeding to line 5. The text <code>Entering down_up: 2</code> is output. Moving to line 6, a recursive call is made <code>down_up(1)</code>, and upon entering that function we skip the base case, outputting <code>Entering down_up(1)</code>. Moving to line 6, a final recursive call is made <code>down_up(0)</code>. This time we enter the function one line 1, and here is the state of the call stack at that point:</p>
<img src="chapters/recursion/down_up_stack.png" alt="Call stack for a recursive function" width="150"/>
<p>This time, since n is 0, we enter the base case and output <code>Done</code>. Now we begin returning from the recursive calls. When the first frame is popped off the stack, we re-enter the call to <code>down_up</code> with n = 1 on line 6. Proceeding to line 7, we output <code>Continuing down_up: 1</code>. The function is done executing, so we pop the top frame off the stack, returning to line 6 in the call with n = 2. Then on line 7, we output <code>Continuing down_up: 2</code>. Again this function is done executing, we pop the top frame from the stack, and proceed to line 7 of the call to <code>down_up</code> with n = 3. We output <code>Continuing down_up: 3</code>. The complete output is:</p>
<pre><code>Entering down_up: 3
Entering down_up: 2
Entering down_up: 1
Done
Continuing down_up: 1
Continuing down_up: 2
Continuing down_up: 3
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that lines executed <em>before</em> the recursive call are executed as the stack is being built, so they occur in the order that n is passed to the function (in this case, since we call <code>down_up(n-1)</code>, the values of n are decreasing). But lines executed <em>after</em> the recursive call are executed as the stack unwinds. So they are output in the reverse order.</p>

<p>The python package <code>numpy</code> provides a wide swath of computational power that is done on fixed-size lists. Using <code>numpy</code> arrays rather than python lists provides significant efficiency improvements when doing large computations. NumPy is an open-source package. In this chapter we cover <code>numpy</code> arrays, but please see <a href="https://numpy.org">Numpy Official Website</a> for information on the package's comprehensive mathematical offerings. </p>

<h2 id="what-is-numpy"><a class="header" href="#what-is-numpy">What is numpy?</a></h2>
<p>Numpy (pronounced &quot;num-pie&quot;) is a python library for performing mathematical and numerical operations. 
It is used extensively in scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning. 
Numpy provides a high-performance, multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays.</p>
<p>To use numpy on your own computer you'll need to install the library. You can do so by running the following python script in VSCode:</p>
<pre><code>import sys
import subprocess
subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, &quot;-m&quot;, &quot;pip&quot;, &quot;install&quot;, &quot;numpy&quot;])
import numpy as np
</code></pre>
<p>Note that you should only need to run this script once. If it successfully installs, you should see no errors.</p>
<p>Once you have successfully installed numpy, the conventonal usage of numpy is to import the module at the beginning of your file like this:</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np
</code></pre>
<p>We can now use dot-notation on the <code>np</code> object to create and interact with numpy arrays. 
In the remainder of this text, we will assume the numpy has been imported with the line above
This means we will use <code>np</code> to access all numpy functions.</p>
<h2 id="numpy-arrays-vs-python-lists"><a class="header" href="#numpy-arrays-vs-python-lists">Numpy arrays vs. Python lists</a></h2>
<p>A numpy array is similar to a python list in that it is an ordered collection of elements. 
However, numpy arrays are homogeneous, meaning all elements must be of the same type. 
This allows numpy arrays to be more efficient for numerical operations and to use less memory in comparison to python lists.
While this increase in efficiency won't show up for small programs, once you begin doing extensive computations, the
increase in speed is significant.</p>

<p>An existing python list can be used to produce a numpy array using the <code>np.array()</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>c = np.array([1, 2, 3])
print(type(c))  # outputs &quot;&lt;class 'numpy.ndarray'&gt;&quot;
print(c)        # outputs &quot;[1 2 3]&quot;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="creating-a-numpy-array-of-a-fixed-size"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-numpy-array-of-a-fixed-size">Creating a numpy array of a fixed size</a></h3>
<p>When you create a numpy array, it's typical to create the entire array at once with a specified size.
This is different from our common strategy of creating an empty python list, then appending elements to it.
While it's possible to create an empty numpy array, and then append to or remove elements from it, for the sake
of efficiency it is far more common for us to create an array of a fixed-size and not to modify its size once
it has been instantiated.
A numpy array is similar to the &quot;array&quot; data type in languages like C/C++/Java. 
Learning to work with numpy arrays will help prepare you to write code in those languages, including systems-level programs.</p>
<p>Below you'll see four <code>np</code> functions for creating arrays:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>np.zeros(size: int)</code> function instantiates a numpy array of the given size, initializing all values to 0.
These values can then be changed later, filling the array with data from some source.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python">a = np.zeros(5) # Create an array of zeros with length 5
print(a)        # outputs [0 0 0 0 0]
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The <code>np.ones(size: int)</code> function instantiates a numpy array of the given size, initializing all values to 1.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python">b = np.ones(10) # Create an array of ones with length 10
print(b)        # outputs [1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The <code>np.empty(size:int)</code> function instantiates a numpy array of a given size, without initializing its values.
This means that space in memory is reserved for the array, but whatever values happened to be in memory at
the moment the array was instantiated remain as the values in that array.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python">d = np.empty(3) # Create an array with length 10, contents uninitialized
print(d)        # outputs, for example, [-2.68156159e+154 -2.68156159e+154  4.70372193e+00]
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The <code>np.random.rand(size:int)</code> method instantiates a numpy array of a given size, initialized with random values in the interval [0,1).</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python">e = np.random.rand(4). # Create an array with 4 random values
print(e)               # outputs, for example, [0.04434599 0.71186025 0.14798285 0.96437171]
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that when the contents of a numpy array are output to the terminal, the values are separated just by spaces, not by commas.
This is a visual reminder to you that you are using a numpy array, not a python list.</p>
<h2 id="use-the-size-attribute-to-find-the-size-of-an-existing-numpy-array"><a class="header" href="#use-the-size-attribute-to-find-the-size-of-an-existing-numpy-array">Use the <code>size</code> attribute to find the size of an existing numpy array.</a></h2>
<p>Numpy arrays have a <code>size</code> attribute, which gives the total number of elements in the array:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">f = np.array([5, 0, -5])
print(f.size)  # outputs 3
</code></pre>
<h2 id="every-python-array-stores-one-data-type-called-dtype"><a class="header" href="#every-python-array-stores-one-data-type-called-dtype">Every python array stores one data type (called <code>dtype</code>)</a></h2>
<p>The data type (<code>dtype</code>) of a numpy array determines the type of elements it can hold. 
Common dtypes include int, float, bool, and string. 
When creating a numpy array, the <code>dtype</code> can be specified explicitly, otherwise it is inferred from the input data.
You cannot modify the dtype of a numpy array after it has been instantiated.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<pre><code>a = np.array([1, 2, 3])      # type is inferred to be an int
print(a.dtype)               # outputs int64
b = np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype = float) # Specifying dtype when creating an array
print(b.dtype)               # outputs float64
c = np.array([1, 2, 3.5])    # the dtype of float is inferred from input data
print(c.dtype)               # outputs float64
d = np.zeros(5)              # np.zeros by default uses dtype of float
print(d.dtype)               # outputs float64
e = np.zeros(3, dtype = int) # you can specify the dtype
print(e.dtype)               # outputs int64
</code></pre>
<p>In numpy arrays, the type <code>int64</code> has a fixed size of 64 bits (8 bytes). This means that the integers that can be stored have a minimum value of -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 and a maximum value of 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 (inclusive). This is unlike the python <code>int</code> type, which can hold to an unlimited value, increasing behind the scenes the storage space used to store the number.</p>

<p>Once a numpy array is created, you can access and modify it using indexing and slicing, similar to a python list.
Here are some examples:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import numpy as np
# instantiate a numpy array, 10 elements, dtype of float64
a = np.empty(10)

# access elements in an array using the index values
# initialize the contents  using a loop
for i in range(a.size):
    a[i] = i+1
print(a) # outputs [ 1.  2.  3.  4.  5.  6.  7.  8.  9. 10.]

# Indexes and slices:
print(a[0])    # use an index to access a single element, outputs 1.0
print(a[2:4])  # use a slice to access multiple elements, outputs [3. 4.]

# Modifying elements
a[0] = 0
print(a)  # output [ 0.  2.  3.  4.  5.  6.  7.  8.  9. 10.]


# Performing operations using functions that are part of numpy
print(np.sum(a))  # outputs 54.0
print(np.max(a))  # outputs 10.0
print(np.min(a))  # outputs 0.0
print(np.mean(a)) # outputs 5.4
</code></pre>
<h2 id="matrix-operations-that-are-specific-to-numpy"><a class="header" href="#matrix-operations-that-are-specific-to-numpy">Matrix operations that are specific to numpy</a></h2>
<p>In addition, many simple matrix-math operations that do not work with lists are possible with numpy arrays.
Operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication are computed component-wise.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># instantiate a numpy array
b = np.array([1, 2, 3])

# addition: the constant 2 is added to every element in b, producing a new numpy array
print(b + 2)  # outputs &quot;[3 4 5]&quot;

# subtraction
print(b - 2)  # outputs &quot;[-1  0  1]&quot;

# multiplication - the constant 2 is multiplied by every element in b, producing a new numpy array
print(b * 2)  # outputs &quot;[2 4 6]&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>If we combine two arrays using a mathematical operator such as addition, 
then the result is a new array, whose elements are computed by individually adding the corresponding elements in the two arrays.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># addition
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])
c = a + b
print(c)  # outputs &quot;[5 7 9]&quot;

# subtraction
d = b - a
print(d)  # outputs &quot;[3 3 3]&quot;

# multiplication
e = a * b
print(e)  # outputs &quot;[4 10 18]&quot;

<p>A multidimensional array is an array of arrays, in much the same way a multidimensional list is a list of lists. One of Numpy's strengths is the tools it has for making it easier to work with higher-dimensional arrays.</p>
<h2 id="creating-multi-dimensional-numpy-arrays-from-an-existing-python-list"><a class="header" href="#creating-multi-dimensional-numpy-arrays-from-an-existing-python-list">Creating multi-dimensional numpy arrays from an existing python list</a></h2>
<p>Use the <code>numpy.array()</code> function, much like you saw for one-dimensional array, but pass a two-dimensional python list (a list of lists) as the argument. Note: the nested list you pass must be rectangular (not jagged), so it must have the same number of elements in each row.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Creating a 2D-Numpy array
arr_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]])
</code></pre>
<h2 id="the-shape-attribute-of-an-array"><a class="header" href="#the-shape-attribute-of-an-array">The <code>shape</code> attribute of an array</a></h2>
<p>You can find out the number of rows and columns in a multi-dimensional <code>numpy</code> array using the <code>shape</code> attribute, which is a tuple giving the number of rows, then the number of columns. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">arr_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]])
print(arr_2d)
print(arr_2d.shape)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>[[ 1  2  3]
 [ 4  5  6]
 [ 7  8  9]
 [10 11 12]]
(4, 3)
</code></pre>
<p>Notice the following in the above output:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you output the contents of a <code>numpy</code> array, the rows are each given on a separate line (unlike python lists).</li>
<li>The shape of the above <code>numpy</code> array is (4, 3), since it has 4 rows and 3 columns. Use <code>arr_2d.shape[0]</code> and <code>arr_2d.shape[1]</code> to individually access the number of rows and number of columns.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="creating-fixed-size-multidimensional-numpy-arrays"><a class="header" href="#creating-fixed-size-multidimensional-numpy-arrays">Creating fixed-size multidimensional <code>numpy</code> arrays</a></h2>
<p>You can use the <code>np.zeros()</code>, <code>np.ones()</code>, <code>np.empty()</code>, and <code>np.random.rand()</code> functions we saw in a previous section to create multidimensional lists. Instead of passing the size (and potentially a <code>dtype</code>) as arguments, pass the <code>shape</code> (and potentially a <code>dtype</code>) as arguments. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">arr_zero = np.zeros(shape = (2, 3), dtype = int)
print(arr_zero)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>[[0 0 0]

<p>Though we will not do so in this course, you can create three-dimensional <code>numpy</code> arrays or python lists (or even higher dimensions) by increasing the level of nesting. This is not just fun, but also phenomenonally useful in data science, mathematics, physics, geography, and other fields. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># nesting of 2 arrays that are each shape 3x4:
arr_3d = np.zeros(shape = (2, 3, 4), dtype = int)
print(arr_3d)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>[[[0 0 0 0]
  [0 0 0 0]
  [0 0 0 0]]

 [[0 0 0 0]
  [0 0 0 0]
  [0 0 0 0]]]
</code></pre>
<h1 id="accessing-elements-using-comma-based-indexing"><a class="header" href="#accessing-elements-using-comma-based-indexing">Accessing Elements: using comma-based indexing</a></h1>
<p>Recall that for nested python lists, we use a pair of square brackets to indicate <em>each</em> index. This notation highlights that a nested list in python is a list of lists.
For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># using python lists:
list_2d = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]
# Access the element in row index 0, column index 2:
print(list_2d[0][2]) # Output: 3
</code></pre>
<p>In contrast, with <code>numpy</code> arrays, we use one pair of square brackets, separating the index values with a comma:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># using numpy arrays:
arr_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]])
# Access the element in row index 0, column index 2:
print(arr_2d[0, 2])  # Output: 3
</code></pre>
<p>To accommodate naive users, python does allow you to use the double-bracket style of indexing even with <code>numpy</code> arrays:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">arr_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]])
print(arr_2d[0, 2])  # Output: 3
print(arr_2d[0][2])  # Also outputs 3, but this style is highly discouraged
</code></pre>
<p>But you should avoid this syntax for indexing in <code>numpy</code> arrays, because with it you lose the efficiency improvement that <code>numpy</code> arrays provide over python lists.</p>
<h2 id="slicing-numpy-arrays"><a class="header" href="#slicing-numpy-arrays">Slicing <code>numpy</code> arrays</a></h2>
<p>Slicing in <code>numpy</code> arrays is more powerful than in python lists, since it allows you to slice along columns in addition to rows. For example, the following code allows you to create a <code>numpy</code> array from a single column of a 2D array. This allows you to do numerical computations on individual rows and columns much more fluidly!</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Create a 2D Numpy array
arr = np.array([[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]])

# Access a single column of the Numpy array
numpy_column = arr[:, 1] # include all the rows, and only the second column (index 1 column)
# Compute and output the sum of the individual column:
print(sum(numpy_column))
</code></pre>
<p>Compare the above to the analogous code using python lists</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Create a 2D Python list
lst = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]]

# Access a single column of the Python list
python_column = [row[1] for row in lst] # iterate over the rows grabbing the second column
print(python_column)
print(sum(python_column))

<p>Algorithms are, simply put, a sequence of instructions to perform a task given a set of input values. Later courses will go into more detail about algorithm design, analysis, and efficiency.
Algorithms that sort are a great introduction into the world of algorithms and are also extremely useful in practice.
Although this course will not go into details about algorithms (look forward to Data Structures and Algorithms I, II and III!), we will get a feel for what an algorithm is, in particular by using sorting as an example.</p>
<p>Sorting is the quintessential algorithm in computer science. To sort means to arrange a sequence of elements in order. The act of sorting can be useful in many situations, even outside of computer science. Perhaps you sort bills in your wallet to more easily find 1-dollar bills versus 5-dollar bills. When you play any sort of card game, you might sort the cards in your hand to better understand the distribution of your cards and therefore more easily strategize your next move. On many websites, whether it's the course schedule on MyDU or a community forum like Reddit, information is likely sorted by certain criteria to better display the content on the page.</p>
<p>Interestingly, sorting comes up extremely often in computer science. As you take more advanced courses, you'll see why it is so important to understand sorting algorithms because of its ubiquity. Due to its importance, there are many, many sorting algorithms out there, though only a small portion are widely used in practice.

<p>If data items are sorted, there is a very fast recursive algorithm (binary search) for locating the item you are looking for. But if data items are unsorted, you have to look at each item, one after the other, to find the item you are looking for. This is much slower. Therefore, we often store data in sorted form. Sorting is essentially important in Computer Science!</p>
<p>In python there are multiple built-in methods/functions to sort data.</p>
<ul>
<li>The python list <code>sort()</code> method.</li>
<li>The python <code>sorted()</code> function.</li>
<li>The numpy array <code>sort()</code> method.</li>
<li>The numpy <code>sorted()</code> function.</li>
</ul>
<p>Differences between the above methods/functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>sort()</code> is a method (called with <code>listtname.sort()</code> or <code>arrayname.sort()</code>) that sorts the list or array in place (i.e., it modifies the list or array). It returns <code>None</code>.</li>
<li><code>sorted()</code> is a function (called with <code>sorted(listtname)</code> or <code>sorted(arrayname))</code> that returns a new sorted list (or array), leaving the original unchanged.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-sort-functionsmethods-we-will-implement"><a class="header" href="#the-sort-functionsmethods-we-will-implement">The sort functions/methods we will implement</a></h2>
<p>There are many strategies for sorting data. We will see four sorting algorithms in this course.
You will learn how to implement these first three:</p>
<ul>
<li>Selection sort</li>
<li>Insertion sort</li>
<li>Bubble sort</li>
</ul>
<p>These three algorithms rely on nested loops, and are the easiest to learn and understand. So first-year Computer Science students always learn them. But they are also notoriously slow, and so are <em>never</em> used in practice!</p>
<p>One exampe of a better sorting algorithm is merge sort. You will see a demo of this fourth algorithm, which relies on recursion. The point of the demonstration is for you to see how much faster it runs than any of the other three algorithms.</p>
<p>There are many other strategies for sorting that you will see in future courses.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="selection-sort"><a class="header" href="#selection-sort">Selection sort</a></h1>
<p>Selection sort is a notoriously inefficient sorting algorithm, but easier to understand than efficient strategies that you will learn in later courses. That's why it's frequently taught to first-year Computer Science students as a great application of nested loops.</p>
<p>The strategy of selection sort is to reorder the array in place by repeatedly selecting the smallest remaining element in an array, then swapping it with the value in the first unsorted position of the array.</p>
<h2 id="first-pass"><a class="header" href="#first-pass">First pass</a></h2>
<p>The first pass of the algorithm performs these tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Traverse the array with a for-loop, determining the index of the smallest value in the entire array.</li>
<li>Swap that value with the first element (index 0 value) in the array.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, suppose that the array starts with the following contents:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">[8, 18, 6, 47, 23, 7]
</code></pre>
<p>In the first pass, we determine that the minimum value is 6, located at index 2. Here is a sample of code that will find this information:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">min_index = 0
for i in range(arr.size):
    if arr[i] &lt; arr[min_index]:
        min_index = i
</code></pre>
<p>At the end of execution, <code>min_index</code> is 2, and the minimum value of 6 is stored at <code>arr[min_index]</code>.
This tells us to swap the value stored at position 0 (an 8) with the value stored at position <code>min_index</code> (a 6). Here's the code that performs the swap:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">temp = arr[min_index]
arr[min_index] = arr[0]
arr[0] = temp
</code></pre>
<p>When the first pass is complete, the contents of the array are:</p>
<pre><code>[6, 18, 8, 47, 23, 7]
</code></pre>
<p>At this point, the first element of the array is considered sorted, since it contains the final value that belongs at that position.</p>
<h2 id="second-pass"><a class="header" href="#second-pass">Second pass</a></h2>
<p>The second pass of the algorithm performs the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Traverse the array with a for-loop, starting at the second element (index 1), locating the second-smallest element.</li>
<li>Swap that value with the second element in the array (index 1 element).</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's the code that performs these two tasks. Notice what is different in this code from the first pass: we start with <code>min_index</code> as 1, the first position in the <em>unsorted</em> part of the array. Then when searching for the next-smallest value, the search begins not at index 0, but at index 1, the first position in the unsorted part of the array. Finally, in the swap, the value in <code>arr[1]</code> is swapped with the value at <code>min_index</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-python">min_index = 1
for i in range(1, arr.size):
    if arr[i] &lt; arr[min_index]:
        min_index = i
temp = arr[min_index]
arr[min_index] = arr[1]
arr[1] = temp
</code></pre>
<p>After the second pass, the first two positions are finalized, and the contents of the array are:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">[6, 7, 8, 47, 23, 18]
</code></pre>
<h2 id="subsequent-passes"><a class="header" href="#subsequent-passes">Subsequent passes</a></h2>
<p>Realize that each pass through the array chooses the next-smallest element in the unsorted part of the array, and swaps that value with the next position in the array. If we create a variable <code>pass_number</code>, and have it take values from 0 to the last index in the array, then here is the code for finding the index of the next-smallest value, then swapping that value into its correct position:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">min_index = pass_number
for i in range(pass_number, arr.size):
    if arr[i] &lt; arr[min_index]:
        min_index = i
temp = arr[min_index]
arr[min_index] = arr[pass_number]
arr[pass_number] = temp
</code></pre>
<p>To complete the implementation of selection sort, we just need to place this code block within a for-loop that traverses all possible values for <code>pass_number</code>. Notice that we stop <code>pass_number</code> one before the last index, since once the second-to-last value is in its correct position, the last value must be the largest element in the array.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># selection sort:
def selection_sort(arr):
    for pass_number in range(arr.size-1):
        # one pass of selection sort follows.
        # first find the index of the next-smallest number:
        min_index = pass_number
        for i in range(pass_number, arr.size):
            if arr[i] &lt; arr[min_index]:
                min_index = i
        # swap minimum of unsorted part of array with the next spot to be sorted:
        temp = arr[min_index]
        arr[min_index] = arr[pass_number]
        arr[pass_number] = temp

# main code block, small test of the selection sort function:
rand_arr = np.random.rand(10)
selection_sort(rand_arr)
print(rand_arr)
</code></pre>
<h2 id="timing-running-of-selection-sort"><a class="header" href="#timing-running-of-selection-sort">Timing running of selection sort</a></h2>
<p>If you need a refresher on how to time the runnning of functions, see <a href="chapters/sorting/../functions/experimental_runtime.html">measuring runtime for functions</a></p>
<p>The code below times how long it takes for selection sort to run with an array size of 5000:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import time
rand_arr = np.random.rand(5000)
start = time.time()
selection_sort(rand_arr)
stop = time.time()
print(f&quot;Elapsed time for array with 5000 elements: {stop-start:0.2f} seconds&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Sample output:</p>
<pre><code>Elapsed time for array with 5000 elements: 1.48 seconds
</code></pre>
<p>Recall that one way to understand how fast the elapsed time for running this function grows as we increase the size of the array is to double the size of the array to see what happens to the runtime:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">rand_arr = np.random.rand(10000)
start = time.time()
selection_sort(rand_arr)
stop = time.time()
</code></pre>
<p>Sample output:</p>
<pre><code>Elapsed time for array with 10000 elements: 5.73 seconds
</code></pre>
<p>When we doubled the size of the array, the time quadrupled. This significant effect on the runtime as the size of the array increases follows the pattern of \(O(n^2)\) algorithms. It is the \(O(n^2)\ runtime is what makes selection sort so devastatingly slow for large arrays.</p>
<p>In the first Data Structures and Algorithms course, you will learn how to determine the runtime of algorithms more completely using both experimental analysis and theoretical analysis.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="bubble-sort"><a class="header" href="#bubble-sort">Bubble Sort</a></h1>
<p>A second easy-to-implement but unusably-slow sort algorithm is bubble sort.</p>
<p>Here's the idea behind bubble sort: for the first pass, iterate over the array, on each iteration checking <em>adjacent</em> pairs of values. If the values are in the correct order, we don't have to do anything. If they are in the wrong order, swap them. Therefore, on one pass over the array, we will have guaranteed that the maximum element is at the end of the array. The algorithm is called &quot;bubble sort&quot; because you can imagine that on this first pass, the highest value has bubbled up through the array to its rightful last position in the array. Now repeat the process: the second pass &quot;bubbles&quot; the second-largest value to the second-to-last position in the array. Each subsequent pass takes the next-highest value to its correct position in the array. If the array has length n, then n-1 passes are needed.</p>
<p>For example, consider the array</p>
<pre><code>[12  5  7  3]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>First pass</strong>: We iterate over the array, comparing each element to the one <em>following</em> it, swapping if necessary. </p>
<ul>
<li>First compare the value at index 0 to the value at index 1. Since 12 &gt; 5, the two values are swapped:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>[5  12  7, 3]
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Now compare the value at index 1 to the value at index 2. Since 12 &gt; 7, the two values are swapped:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>[5  7  12  3]
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Now compare the value at index 2 to the value at index 3. Since 12 &gt; 3, the two values are swapped:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>[5  7  3  12]
</code></pre>
<p>This is the end of the first pass. We see that 12 has bubbled up to its final position.</p>
<p><strong>Second pass</strong>: We iterate again over the array exactly as before. Note that we don't need the last compare, since 12 is already guaranteed to be in its correct position. We will compare values at index 0 and 1, then values at index 1 and 2.</p>
<ul>
<li>Comparing values at index 0 and index 1, since 5 &lt; 7, no swap is performed, and the array stays as-is.</li>
<li>Comparing values at index 1 and index 2, since 7 &gt; 3, the two values are swapped:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>[5  3  7  12]
</code></pre>
<p>This is the end of the second pass. Now 7 and 12 have both bubbled to their final positions.</p>
<p><strong>Third pass</strong>: We iterate again over the array, this time stopping before comparing to either of the last two elements. This means just one compare and potential swap is needed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Comparing values at index 0 and index 1, since 5 &gt; 3, the two values are swapped:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>[3  5  7  12]
</code></pre>
<p>The array has 4 elements, so 3 passes are needed. At the end of the third pass, the array is completely sorted.</p>
<h2 id="timing-running-of-bubble-sort"><a class="header" href="#timing-running-of-bubble-sort">Timing running of bubble sort</a></h2>
<p>Timing of running of bubble sort, as we did with selection sort, suggests that bubble sort is also a \(O(n^2)\)algorithm, and thus, like selection sort, is <em>never</em> used in practice. In the first Data Structures and Algorithms course, you will learn how to determine the runtime of algorithms more completely using both experimental analysis and theoretical analysis.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="insertion-sort"><a class="header" href="#insertion-sort">Insertion sort</a></h1>
<p>The final easy-to-implement but notoriously-slow sort algorithm we will study is insertion sort.</p>
<p>Like selection sort and bubble sort, insertion sort also is a \(O(n^2))\ algorithm. However, insertion sort has some redeeming features:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is easy to understand, sorting similarly to how humans would sort a stack of papers or a poker hand.</li>
<li>Like selection sort and bubble sort, the sorting happens in place. This means it does not use extra memory.</li>
<li>It is efficient for arrays that are already largely sorted.</li>
<li>It is stable. This means it does not rearrange elements that have the same value.</li>
<li>The list can be sorted as it is received (you don't need to have the entire list before you start the sorting process).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="basic-idea-of-insertion-sort"><a class="header" href="#basic-idea-of-insertion-sort">Basic idea of insertion sort</a></h2>
<p>Insertion sort reorders a list in place. The left-hand side of the array is sorted, while the right-hand side is the unsorted portion. With each pass of the sorting process, the cutoff between unsorted and sorted moves to the right. On each pass, consider the next element of the array (the first one in the as-yet-unsorted portion). This element is slid to the left until it is in the correct position.</p>
<h2 id="example-of-sorting-an-array-with-the-insertion-sort-algorithm"><a class="header" href="#example-of-sorting-an-array-with-the-insertion-sort-algorithm">Example of sorting an array with the insertion sort algorithm</a></h2>
<p>For example, suppose we start with this array:</p>
<pre><code>[8 | 18  6  47  23  7]
</code></pre>
<p>The vertical bar shows the dividing line between the sorted portion of the list (on the left) and the unsorted portion of the list. There is only one number (8) in the unsorted part of the list. Since there is only one number, it is automatically in the correct order.</p>
<h3 id="first-pass-1"><a class="header" href="#first-pass-1">First pass</a></h3>
<p>We now consider the leftmost element of the unsorted portion of the list (18). We slide it left, inserting it in the correct position of the sorted portion. The insertion involves comparing the number to insert (18) to the number on its left, swapping if the number to insert is smaller. This swapping process continues leftward until the number to insert is larger than the number on its left. This time, the first compare shows that 18 &gt; 8, so no swapping is needed at all. Here is the list after this pass:</p>
<pre><code>[8  18 | 6  47  23  7]
</code></pre>
<h3 id="second-pass-1"><a class="header" href="#second-pass-1">Second pass</a></h3>
<p>We again look at the leftmost element of the unsorted portion of the list (6). We compare it to the number on its left, and 18 &gt; 6. Thus we swap:</p>
<pre><code>[8  6  18 | 47  23  7]
</code></pre>
<p>Continuing to insert 6 in the correct location, we compare to its neighbor to the left. 8 &gt; 6, so we swap again:</p>
<pre><code>[6  8  18 | 47  23  7]
</code></pre>
<p>The number 6 has been inserted into the left-hand side of the list, so the left portion is fully sorted.</p>
<h3 id="third-pass"><a class="header" href="#third-pass">Third pass</a></h3>
<p>We now insert 47 into the sorted part of the list. Since 18 &lt; 47, no swapping is necessary:</p>
<pre><code>[6  8  18  47 | 23  7]
</code></pre>
<h3 id="fourth-pass"><a class="header" href="#fourth-pass">Fourth pass</a></h3>
<p>We now insert 23 into the sorted part of the list. As before, we compare to the number on its left. First 47 &gt; 23, so we swap. Then 18 &lt; 23, so no swap is needed, nor any additional compares.</p>
<pre><code>[6  8  18  23  47 | 7]
</code></pre>
<h3 id="last-pass"><a class="header" href="#last-pass">Last pass</a></h3>
<p>We insert 7 into the sorted part of the list. Notice that 5 compares and 4 swaps are needed to move 7 leftward to its proper position. Comparing to the leftmost element, 6 &lt; 7, shows that the insertion of the final element is complete:</p>
<pre><code>[6  7  8  18  23  47]
</code></pre>
<h2 id="online-sorting"><a class="header" href="#online-sorting">Online sorting</a></h2>
<p>Notice that if additional data are added after the insert sort is complete, those elements can be inserted into the list once they are received. This ability to process the values piece-by-piece in a serial fashion is known as &quot;online sorting&quot;. Online sorting is useful when data is arriving in a continuous stream, such as a live data stream.</p>
<h2 id="time-efficiency-considerations"><a class="header" href="#time-efficiency-considerations">Time efficiency considerations</a></h2>
<p>If an already-sorted list is processed with insert-sort, the insertion of each new element requires only one compare, and no swapping. Thus, the algorithm runs in \(O(n)\) time. If the list is largely sorted, few extra compares and swaps are needed. So insert sort is actually an efficient algorithm for lists that are mostly sorted, but have just a few elements out of place.</p>
